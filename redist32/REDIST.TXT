AXDist.exe, WINTDist.exe, WINT351.exe, CCDist.exe, CCDist35.exe, and APRXDist.exe are self 
extracting installation files which are intended to be the only vehicle through which 
ISVs can redistribute and install The DLLs with their ActiveX code.  Their 
purpose is to allow ISVs to ship code without being dependent on the presence of 
Internet Explorer 3.0 on the target machine.  

These files are in release form.  This agreement supersedes all other agreements with respect to 
AXDist.exe, WINTDist.exe, WINT351.exe, CCDist.exe, CCDist35.exe, and APRXDist.exe, and 
The DLLs.  In addition to the rights granted in Section 1 of the Development License Agreement 
("Agreement"), you have the right to redistribute AXDist.exe, WINTDist.exe, WINT351.exe, CCDist.exe, 
CCDist35.exe, and APRXDist.exe subject to the following non-exclusive stipulations.

You may not modify AXDist.exe or WINTDist.exe, or The DLLs it installs.

You may not redistribute The DLLs under any other circumstances except by using AXDist.exe, 
WINTDist.exe, WINT351.exe, CCDist.exe, CCDist35.exe, or APRXDist.exe

If you have shipped previous version of these installation files, you must now upgrade your
installed base with your next product release. 

You may freely distribute these files within your company for development purposes of your 
ActiveX project.

This licensing agreement is subject to change without warning.

If AXDist.exe, WINTDist.exe, WINT351.exe, CCDist.exe, CCDist35.exe, and APRXDist.exe do not meet 
your distribution needs of The DLLs, you must send detailed feedback to the AXDistB1@microsoft.com 
(that is for "ActiveX SDK Redistributables, Beta 1").
