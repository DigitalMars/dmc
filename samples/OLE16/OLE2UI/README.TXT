			  OLE2UI
		  OLE 2 User Interface


Please see the files MAKEDLL and MAKELIB for building instructions.  
You may also find useful information in the README.TXT file.

MAKEDLL is set to build a private user interface library, OUTLUI.DLL,
for the OUTLINE samples included with Symantec C++.  If you build the 
OLE2UI library as a DLL, you MUST give the DLL a unique name.  You 
must redefine the LIBNAME variable inside MAKEDLL to do this.
