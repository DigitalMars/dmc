 * Return Value:
 *  None.  If any of the LoadCursor calls fail, then the corresponding
 *  array entry is NULL and NewUICursorLoad will fail.  Better to fail
 *  an app getting a cursor than failing to load the app just for that
 *  reason; and app can attempt to load the cursor on startup if it's
 *  that important, and fail itself.

 *
 * Parameters:
 *  iCursor         UINT index to the cursor to load which must be one
 *                  of the following values:
 *
 *                      IDC_RIGHTARROW    Right pointing standard arrow
 *                      IDC_CONTEXTHELP   Arrow with a ? (context help)
 *                      IDC_MAGNIFY       Magnifying glass for zooming
 *                      IDC_NODROP        Circle with a slash

 *                      IDC_VARROWS       Vertical two-headed arrow
 *                      IDC_NESWARROWS    Two-headed arrow pointing NE<->SW
 *                      IDC_NWSEHARROWS   Two-headed arrow pointing NW<->SE
 *
 *                      IDC_HSIZEBAR      Horizontal two-headed arrow with
 *                                        a single vertical bar down the
 *                                        middle
 *
 *                      IDC_VSIZEBAR      Vertical two-headed arrow with a
 *                                        single horizontal bar down the

 *
 *                      IDC_VSPLITBAR     Vertical two-headed arrow with split
 *                                        double horizontal bars down the
 *                                        middle
