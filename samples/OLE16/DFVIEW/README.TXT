DFVIEW Compound File Viewer Utility
-----------------------------------

This utility allows you to view the structure of a disk-based compound file.
The streams and storages contained in the file are displayed in a Windows
File-Manager-type expandable listbox.  To use this utility, simply select
the File.Open menu and choose a compound file to view.

The OUTLINE series of samples all use compound files as their native
file format, so DFVIEW will read any of the files generated by these
samples.  DFVIEW will also create a sample compound file, which you can
load into DFVIEW and view.  To do this, select
"Create Test Storage File TEST.DFL" from the File menu.

DFVIEW As Sample Code
---------------------

The source code to DFVIEW is also included in the OLE SDK to demonstrate
basic read/write/enumerate operations using OLE Compound files,
as well as to demonstrate how to link with the static-link version of
the OLE2UI library.

Compiling DFVIEW
----------------

The DFVIEW makefile assumes that your environment variables have
been set up in accordance with the instructions in RELNOTES.WRI.

The makefile links with the static-link version of the OLE2UI
library, MOLEUIC.LIB.
