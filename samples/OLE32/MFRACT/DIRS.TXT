bin:
    Target directory for the .EXE, .HLP and .DLLs.

winhlprs:
    Various helper classes to simplify writing Windows code in C++.
    Produces a library called winhlprs.lib.

idl:
    The custom interfaces used by MFract and its fractal engines.
    Produces a set of .h files and a library called fguids.lib which
    contains all the IIDs for the interfaces.
    Run build -nmake clean in this directory to delete midl generated files.

app:
    Source files for the main application.
    Produces MFract.exe.

help:
    Produces the help file.

engines:
    Sources for the various fractal engine objects.

engines\mandel:
    Sources for the Mandelbrot Fractal engine.
    Produces mandel.dll.

engines\julia:
    Sources for the Julia Set Fractal engine.
    Produces julia.dll.

engines\quad:
    Sources for the Quadrant Fractal engine.
    Produces quad.dll.
    This component is used by fractal engines such as the Mandelbrot and Julia
    Set objects to simplify the amount of code that they have to write.
    Using this component allows the Mandelbrot and Julia Sets to get away with
    providing only a property dialog implementation, persistence, and a simple
    point-to-color mapping function.  The Quadrant engine takes care of
    iterating across the graph, drawing the points, and optimizing areas where
    possible.

engines\plasma:
    Sources for the Plasma Fractal engine.
    Produces plasma.dll.

engines\rgen:
    Sources for the Recursive Generator engine.
    Produces rgen.dll.
