//  FUNCTION: DLLMain(HINSTANCE, DWORD, LPVOID)
//
//  PURPOSE:  Called when DLL is loaded by a process, and when new
//    threads are created by a process that has already loaded the
//    DLL.  Also called when threads of a process that has loaded the
//    DLL exit cleanly and when the process itself unloads the DLL.
//
//  PARAMETERS:
//    hDLLInst    - Instance handle of the DLL
//    fdwReason   - Process attach/detach or thread attach/detach
//    lpvReserved - Reserved and not used
//
//  RETURN VALUE:  (Used only when fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
//    TRUE  -  Used to signify that the DLL should remain loaded.
//    FALSE -  Used to signify that the DLL should be immediately unloaded.
//
//  COMMENTS:
//
//    If you want to use C runtime libraries, keep this function named
//    "DllMain" and you won't have to do anything special to initialize
//    the runtime libraries.
//
//    When fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, the return value is used to
//    determine if the DLL should remain loaded, or should be immediately
//    unloaded depending upon whether the DLL could be initialized properly.
//    For all other values of fdwReason, the return value is ignored.
