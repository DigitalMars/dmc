All multimedia samples are 32 bit.  Some application will also
compile as 16 bit to help you port your own 16 bit applications
to 32 bit.

Sample		Description
---------       -------------------------------------------
ACMAPP          Displays wave file format, and plays, 
		records, and converts wave files.
		Compiles both 16 and 32 bit.

AVIEDIT 	Simple AVI editing application using the
		editing APIs in AVIFile.

AVIVIEW         Simple AVI viewing application using the 
		read/write APIs in AVIFile.

CAPTEST         Sample capture application that uses the 
		AVICap capture window class.

DSEQFILE	AVIFile file handler for DIB sequences.
		Implemented in C++.

ICMAPP		Shows how to call the ICM APIs.

ICWALK		Sample application that shows all the
		codecs installed on the system. Uses the
		ICM APIs.

JOYTOY		Sample joystick application.

MPLAY		Simple AVI playback application. Includes
		a subset of the features in Media Player 
		and uses the MCIWnd window class.

PALMAP		Stream handler that translates video
		streams into new streams of a different
		bit depth--for example, it can  translate 
		from 24-bit to 8-bit.

REVERSE 	Simple application that will play a waveform
		in reverse.

SOUNDAPP	Simple application showing the SndPlaySound API.

SVXFILE 	AVIFile file handler for Commodore Amiga audio
