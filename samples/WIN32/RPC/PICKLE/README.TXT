
This directory has 2 subdirectories with pickling samples:

        PICKLP  -  Procedure pickling sample,
        PICKLT  -  Type pickling sample.

Each sample demonstrates a fixed buffer style pickling and an incremental
style pickling depending on the switches being used.

The implicit primitive handle is used as the pickling handle.

With default switches, both samples encode data to a file.
To decode data from the file, use -d switch.
