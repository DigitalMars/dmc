Fractal Screen Saver

    The screen saver draws the Mandelbrot Set on the screen.  Then
    save the picture in the path as specified in the configuration
    dialog box.  The default is c:\fractal.bmp.

    When it is done it animates the palette (for palette-managable
    device only.)

    User can specify the area of the Mandelbrot Set to draw as well
    as the number of iternations.

    To install the screen saver, copy the executable fractal.scr
    to the .\nt\system32 directory.  Then install the screen saver
    in the control panel.
