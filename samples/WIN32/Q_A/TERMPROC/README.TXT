 Sample: Simple Demonstration of Opening and Terminating a
Process

Summary:

This simple piece of code demostrates how to open and
terminate a process, for situations where it is impossible
to do so otherwise.  Pstat.exe can be used to obtain the
Process ID (PID) of the process to be terminated.  Note that
the app. does the dec-hex conversion as is neccessary.
