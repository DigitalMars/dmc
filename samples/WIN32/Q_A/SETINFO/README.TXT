 Sample: Demonstration of Setting File Attributes

Summary:

The SETINFO.EXE sample shows how to get and set file
information on date, time, attributes, and size. It
demonstrates much of the functionality of OS/2's
DosQFileInfo and DosSetFileInfo.

This sample more specifically shows how to set file
attributes, how to modify file time and date time (and how
to do the conversions of file time to DosTime etc.).  To
use: enter a file name in the appropriate edit field and
click the Get Info. button.  To set file attributes or file
date and time information, modify the values in the edit
fields and check buttons, and click the Set Info. and Set
Attr. buttons.  To slow down the return code reporting,
enter a larger value into the time edit field, and click the
Set Time button.
