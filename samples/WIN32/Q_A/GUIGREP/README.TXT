Sample: Guigrep File Manager extension sample

Summary:

The GUIGREP SDK sample implements a file manager extension which can serve
as a source file browser. Similar to the grep utility, it will find 
occurrences of a search string in files that can be selected through the file
manager. 

More information:

The sample demonstrates multithreading, structured exception handling, C++
code, file manager extension functionalities, and memory mapped file
manipulation. A very small application (ntgrep.exe) "installs" the file
manager extension by adding an entry to winfile.ini.
