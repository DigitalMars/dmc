/****************************** Module Header *******************************
* Module Name: VIEW.C
*
* Maps rows in window to items in COMPLIST
*
* Functions:
*
* view_new()
* view_setcomplist()
* view_getcomplist()
* view_close()
* view_delete()
* view_outline()
* view_expand()
* view_gettext()
* view_getlinenr_left()
* view_getlinenr_right()
* view_getwidth()
* view_getrowcount()
* view_getstate()
* view_getitem()

* view_changeviewoptions()
* view_changediffoptions()
* view_findchange()
* view_outline_opt()
* view_freemappings()
* view_findrow()
* view_expand_item()
*
* Comments:
*
* A view owns a COMPLIST, and talks to a table window. The table window
* shows 3 columns: line nr, tag and text. We also need to supply a state
* for each row (used to select colour scheme).
*
* The COMPLIST can give us a list of its COMPITEMs. Each of these can give
* us a tag (eg the filenames compared) and the text (usually the compare
* result), and the state. We make the line number from the
* COMPITEM's place in the list.
*
* If we are asked to switch to 'expand' mode, we ask the selected COMPITEM
* for its composite section list. We can then get the state (and thus
* the tag) from each SECTION, and the line nr and text from the LINEs within
* each section.
*
* When moving between expand and outline, and when refreshing the view
* for some option change, we have to be careful to keep the current row
* and the selected row in the table what the user would expect.
*
* Functions in this module can be called from the UI thread (to refresh
* the display) and simultaneously from a worker thread to update the
* view mapping (view_setcomplist, view_newitem). We use a critical section
* to manage the synchronisation. We need to protect all access/modification
* to the view structure elements (particularly bExpand, rows, pLines and
* pItems), BUT we must not hold the critical section over any calls
* to SendMessage.
*
* We use the global options in windiff.h, and we allocate memory from the
* heap hHeap which has been initialised elsewhere. Points in time-intensive
* loops call Poll() defined elsewhere.
