* Comments:
*
* A section is a data type that represents a contiguous block of lines
* of the same state (all unmatched, or all matched to a contiguous block of
* lines). A section can link up matching lines within the section.
*
* Section list functions can make and match lists of sections from lists of
* lines, and create a composite list by combining sections from two lists
* to create a list that 'best represents' the similarities and differences
* between the two lists of lines.
* 
* Assumptions: the lines passed in are on a list (can be traversed with
* List_Next() etc. Line numbering using the section_get*basenr()
* functions work only if lines are numbered sequentially in ascending order.

 * This routine may be called more than once on the same list of lines.

/* Theory of handling blank lines:
|   
|  If ignore_blanks is FALSE then a blank is just another character.
|  If it is TRUE then we will normally include unmatched blanks in whatever
|  section is surrounding them.  It would be nice if we could arrange to
|  never have a section that is only unmatched blanks, but (at least at
|  the start of the file) it can happen.
|
|  Note that there are two DIFFERENT blank handling techniques:
|  In the first phase of the comparison when we are just trying to match up
|  lines, we skip over blank lines both forwards and backwards from an anchor.
|  When we are making real sections for display we only go forwards.
|  This results in a possible anomaly at the top of the whole file where
|  there could be some blanks which do not match and which can only possibly
|  be described as the start of a section.
|  For this reason, we label the sections with their state as early as possible
|  and go by that rather than by the presence or absence of link fields.
|  (It takes some scanning to find a link.  The first line in the section
|  could be a blank).

 *
 * Comments:
 *
 * This function creates a list that corresponds to the 'best' view
 * of the differences between the two lists. We place sections from the
 * two lists into one composite list. Sections that match each other are only
 * inserted once (from the right list). Sections that match, but in different
 * positions in the two lists are inserted twice, once in each position, with
 * status to indicate this. Unmatched sections are inserted in the correct
 * position.
 *
 * - Take sections from the left list until the section is linked to one not
 *   already taken.
 * - Then take sections from right until we find a section linked to one not
 *   already taken.
 * - If the two sections waiting are linked to each other, take them both
 *   (once- we take the right one and advance past both).
 *
 * - Now we have to decide which to take in place and which to declare
 *   'moved'. Consider the case where the only change is that the first line
 *   has been moved to the end. We should take the first line (as a move),
 *   then the bulk of the file (SAME) then the last line (as a move). Hence,
 *   in difficult cases, we take the smaller section first, to ensure that
 *   the larger section is taken as SAME.
 *
 *   To indicate which section has been output, we set the state field
 *   to STATE_MARKED once we have taken it.   States in left and right
 *   lists are of no further interest once we have built the composite.
 *
 *   Up to this point we have worked off the STATE of a section.  By now
 *   all the section links are in place, so we can use them too.
