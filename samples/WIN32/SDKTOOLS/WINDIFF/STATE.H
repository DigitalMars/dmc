 * STATE.H
 *
 * Definition of the results of comparisons for files and for lines
 * within files.
 *
 * These need to be globally declared so that the UI code in windiff.c can
 * map states to the colour scheme (to correctly highlight changed lines).
 *
 * They apply to files (compitem_getstate() ) and to sections in the
 * composite list (section_getstate). All lines within a section have the
 * same state. The UI code will use the view_getstate() function to find the
 * state for a given line on the screen.
