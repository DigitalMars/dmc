* WinHelp used 'footnotes' to keep track of various aspects about a
* particular help page. The three most common footnote types are
* "#", "$", and "K".
* --------------------------------------------------------------------
* # Specifies a context string. The text parameter can be any
*   combination of letters and digits but must not contain spaces.
*   Uppercase and lowercase characters are treated as equivalent
*   characters (case-insensitive). The context string can be used
*   with the \v statement in other topics to create links to this
*   topic. (I'll talk about this later). The Context string should be
*   unique to this help file, and is never actually seen by the user.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------
* $ Specifies a topic title. Windows Help uses the topic title to
*   identify the topic in the Search and History dialog boxes. The
*   text parameter can be any combination of characters including
*   spaces. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------
* K Specifies a keyword. Windows Help displays all keywords in the
*   Help file in the Search dialog box and allows a user to choose
*   a topic to view by choosing a keyword. The text parameter can be
*   any combination of characters including spaces. If the first
*   character is the letter K, it must be preceded with an extra
*   space or a semicolon. More than one keyword can be given by
*   separating the keywords with semicolons (;). A topic cannot
*   contain keywords unless it also has a topic title.

GENERIC: A Windows Application
}
\par

GENERIC is a sample application to illustrate the 'minimum' functionality
 that should be expected of a well behaved Win32 application. Other
 then that, this application has virtually no actual functionality of
 its own. This makes it easier for you to use this as a starting point
 for your own application development, or investigation of the Win32
 API.\par

You are now looking at the \"WinHelp\" file for Generic. It illustrates
 a few of the aspects of a simple Help file for an application.

This is the Contents page of the help file, and should give a very quick
 overview of the application, as well as provide a useful outline of
 the contents of this file so the user can easily navigate through the
 information it contains.

{\comment ************************************************************
* Hot Spots:
* Here is where we actually end up using the 'Context String' data
* that we specify in footnotes. There are two important parts of
* this. First, is the 'label' for the footnote, which is followed
* by the 'destination'. The 'label' must have some sort of underline
* style associated with it. A double underline (as used here) means
* that this is a 'jump' hotspot, which means WinHelp will jump to
* the help topic indicated by the destination. A single underline
* would cause a 'popup' hotspot, which means a popup window is
* brought up temporarily with the help topic data. The 'destination'
* must immediately follow the 'label', and uses the \v attribute
* which would normally make the text 'invisible' or 'hidden' So
* in the first example below, the user would see 'Introduction' on
* their help page, and when they click on it, it jumps to the
* topic with a '#' footnote label of 'INTRODUCTION'. To create
* popup hotspots instead of \uldb, use \ul or \strike.

Generic is intended as an application that essentially has no
 functionality, other then that which should be expected from {\i any}
 Windows application. As such, it should be considered an illustration
 of the {\i minimum} functionality that your application should contain.
