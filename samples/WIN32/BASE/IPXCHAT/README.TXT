IPXCHAT Example Application

This program demonstrates the use of Windows Sockets to communicate 
over the IPX/SPX protocol.

Setup:

IPXCHAT requires that an IPX protocol is loaded.  The "IPX/SPX 
Compatible Transport" shippd in the box is the protocol which was 
used for testing this application.  Make sure that the protocol is
configured correctly for the same frame type on the two machines 
which are talking to each other.

To use IPXCHAT:

There are two sides to a sockets application, the server side (the 
listening side), and the client side (the calling side).  On the first
machine you will need to set up IPXCHAT as the server.  

Start IPXCHAT and select Options->Listen.

You will be prompted to enter a socket number.  A default of 2FFF will be
offered to you although you may change it to anything you want.  Be aware 
that there are well known XNS sockets which you should stay away from.  See
Novell's "IPX Router Specification" for a list of these.

When you select OK, IPXCHAT will initialize Windows Sockets and start
listening on the specified socket.  In the status box of the dialog you
will see a message "listening on <netnum>.<nodenum>.<socknum>" where
netnum will be a number specifying the network number, nodenum specifies
the node number, and socknum specifies the socket number.  You will need
these numbers to enter on the client side in order to connect.

On the second machine (actually it can be the same machine as the server):

Start IPXCHAT and select Options->Connect.

You will be prompted to enter the Network Number, Node Number, and Socket 
Number indicated on the server (the three numbers in the status box of 
the server's listen dialog).  Once you connect you should be able to 
type in the top edit control and it should appear on the bottom of your
counterpart's edit control.
