Sample: Demonstration of the Console API Functions

Summary:

The CONSOLE sample demonstrates the Win32 console API functions. The
program takes no parameters; to start, just run CONSOLE.EXE. After
starting the sample, you can click on one of the functions on the
screen to get a demonstration of that function. When viewing a demo
of the function, the title of the console window is changed to show
the name of the source file where that demo function resides. This
should make it easy to find the sample code where the function of
interest resides.

Please note that some of the demos cover multiple APIs, so some of
the menu choices run the same demo.
