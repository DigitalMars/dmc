<h1>Installation</h1>

Digital Mars has a different view of installation than most software products.
It doesn't need registry entries, environment variable settings, nor does it
need to install anything in the \windows\system directory.
<p>

Consequently, the compiler can be run directly off of the CD without any
need for an install. Just run the programs in \dm\bin. This is most convenient
for cases where a particular version of the compiler is needed, or to just try
it out.
<p>

But of course, running off the CD can be a little slow. The solution is to
xcopy the entire disk to the hard disk, as in:

<pre>
	xcopy g:\*.*/s c:
</pre>

to duplicate it on drive C.
(Do not install into a subdirectory with spaces, tabs,
+ signs, commas, or # characters in the subdirectory or path names.)
Then, append:

<pre>
	c:\dm\bin
</pre>

to the PATH environment setting.
<p>

	Copying the files to the hard disk in this manner from the CD
	can result in them all being marked as read-only. Therefore,
	in order for the IDDE to be able to change its settings, the
	following files must have the read-only attribute turned off.
	The \dm\bin\chmod.exe program will do the trick:

	<pre>
	\dm\bin\chmod -R \dm\bin\brow32.ini
	\dm\bin\chmod -R \dm\bin\scw.ini
	\dm\bin\chmod -R \dm\bin\scw32.cfg
	</pre>

<h2>Creating a Shortcut</h2>

	To put a shortcut to Digital Mars C++ on the desktop for Windows XP:

	<ol>
	<li> Right click on the desktop to bring up the menu.
	<li> Select [New].
	<li> Select [Shortcut].
	<li> Enter:
	<pre>c:\dm\bin\scw32.exe</pre>
	in the [Type the location of the item:] entry box.
	<li> Select [Next]
	<li> Enter:
	<pre>Digital Mars C++</pre>
	in the [Type a name for this shortcut:] entry box.
	<li> Select [Finish]
	</ol>

	Double-clicking on the shortcut will then bring up the
	Digital Mars IDDE.

<h2>Backup</h2>

We recommend that your project directories be separate from the \dm directory.
That way, the project is easilly distinguishable from the compiler, and can
be backed up separately.
<p>

We recommend backing up the Digital Mars CD on the hard disk, or duplicating it
onto another CD with a CDROM burner. This is for backup purposes only, however!


<h2>Uninstalling Digital Mars</h2>

Uninstalling is as simple as erasing the \dm directory and all its
subdirectories. If \dm\bin is in the PATH, edit your setup to remove it.
