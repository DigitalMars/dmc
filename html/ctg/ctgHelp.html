<h1>HC: Help Compiler</h1>

A Help system provides users with online information about an
application. Creating the system requires the efforts of both a
Help writer and a Help programmer. The Help writer plans, writes,
codes, builds, and keeps track of Help topic files, which are text files that 
describe various aspects of the application. The Help programmer 
ensures that the Help system works properly with the application. 
<p>

This chapter assumes you are familiar with the Help application for 
Microsoft Windows 3.x. The advice it contains about how to plan and 
structure Help systems is applicable to Windows NT and Windows 95. 
<p>

For more information on creating Windows Help, see:

<ul>
	<li> Windows Help Authoring Guide, Microsoft Press. 

	<li> Chapter 12, "User Assistance," in Windows Interface 
	Guidelines: A Guide for Designing Software, Microsoft 
	Press. 

	<li> Moving to Windows 95 Help, Blue Sky Software. 
</ul>

<h2>What's in This Chapter</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Planning a Help system. 

	<li> Structuring topic files. 

	<li> Designing, structuring, and coding Help topics. 

	<li> Authoring tools. 

	<li> Dealing with graphic images. 

	<li> Creating the Help Project file. 

	<li> Compiling Help files for Win16 applications. 
</ul>

<h2>Creating a Help System: The Development Cycle</h2>

The creation of a Help system for a Windows application comprises 
the following major tasks: 

<ol>
	<li> Gathering information for Help topics. 

	<li> Planning the Help system. 

	<li> Writing the text for Help topics. 

	<li> Entering all required control codes into the text files. 
	Control codes determine how the user can move around 
	the Help system. 

	<li> Creating a project file for the build. 
	The Help project file provides information that the Help 
	Compiler needs to build a Help resource file. 

	<li> Building the Help resource file. 
	The Help resource file is a compiled version of the topic 
	files the writer creates. 

	<li> Testing and debugging the Help system. 

	<li> Programming the application so it can access Windows 
	Help.
</ol>


<h2>How Help appears to the user</h2>

To the user, the Help system appears to be part of the application and 
is made up of text and graphics displayed in the Help window in front 
of the application. The Help window displays one sample Help topic, 
a partial description of how to perform one task. By pressing the 
mouse button when the cursor is on an underlined word, the user can 
read the definition, which appears in an overlapping box as long as 
the mouse button is held down. 
<p>


Cross-references to related topics are called jumps. By clicking a jump 
term for a related topic (denoted by underlined text), the user 
changes the content of the Help window to a description of the new 
topic or command. 


<h2>How Help appears to the Help writer</h2>

To the writer, the Help system is a group of topic files, which are text 
files that include special codes. To create a topic, the Help writer 
describes the task, formats the text, and inserts codes using 
strikethrough text, underlined text, and footnotes. In place of 
strikethrough, the writer can use double underlining if the word 
processor does not support strikethrough formatting. Footnotes in the 
text contain linking information required by the Help Compiler. 


<h2>How Help appears to the Help programmer</h2>

To the programmer, Windows Help is a stand-alone Windows 
application that the user can run like any other application. Your 
application can call the WinHelp function to ask Windows to run the 
Help application and specify the topic to be displayed in the Help 
window. 
<p>


See the section "Building the Help File" later in this chapter for details 
about the Help application programming interface (API). 


<h2>Planning the Help System</h2>

The initial task for the Help writer is to develop a plan for creating 
the system. This following sections discuss planning the Help system 
for a particular application. 
<p>

These sections cover the following topics: 

<ul>
	<li> Developing a plan 
	<li> Determining the topic file structure 
	<li> Designing the visual appearance of Help topics 
</ul>

<h2>Developing a Plan</h2>

Before you begin writing Help topics using the information you have 
gathered, you and the other members of the Help team should 
develop a plan to: 

<ul>
	<li> Define the audience for your application 
	<li> Plan the content of the Help topics 
	<li> Design the structure of topics 
	<li> Display the use of context-sensitive topics 
</ul>

You might want to present your plan in a design document that 
includes an outline of Help information, a diagram of the structure of 
topics, and samples of the various kinds of topics your system will 
include. Keep in mind that context-sensitive Help requires increased 
development time, especially for the application programmer. 


<h2>Defining the audience</h2>

The audience determines what kind of information you make 
available in your Help system and how you present the information. 
Users of Help systems might be classified as follows: 

<dl>
	<dt>Novice <dd>Completely new to computing. 

	<dt>Beginner <dd>Some knowledge of computing, but new to your 
	kind of application. For example, if you are 
	providing Help for a spreadsheet program, the 
	application novice might be familiar only with 
	word-processing packages. 

	<dt>Experienced <dd>Knowledgeable about your kind of application. 

	<dt>Expert <dd>Extensive experience with your type of 
	application. 
</dl>

Keep in mind that one user may have various levels of knowledge. 
For example, the expert in word processors may have no experience 
using spreadsheets. 


<h2>Designing the content of the Help system</h2>

Create topics that are numerous enough and specific 
enough to provide your users with the help they need. 
Novice users need help learning tasks and definitions of terms. More 
sophisticated users occasionally seek help with a procedure or term, 
but most often refresh their memory of commands and functions. The 
expert user tends to seek help only with command or function syntax, 
keyboard equivalents, and shortcut keys. 
<p>

There are no rules for determining the overall content of your Help 
system. If you are providing Help for all types of users, you will want 
to document commands, procedures, definitions, features, functions, 
and other relevant aspects of your application. If you are providing 
help for expert users only, you might want to omit topics that describe 
procedures. Let your audience definition guide you when deciding 
what topics to include. 
<p>


Keep in mind that the decision to implement context-sensitive Help 
is an important one. Context-sensitive Help demands a close working 
relationship between the Help author and the application 
programmer and, therefore, increases the development time 
necessary to create a successful Help system. 


<h2>Planning the structure of Help topics</h2>

Many Help systems structure topics hierarchically. At the top of the 
hierarchy is an index or a table of contents, or both. The index and 
table of contents list individual topics or categories of topics available 
to the user. 
<p>

Topics themselves can be related hierarchically. Each successive step 
takes the user down one level in the hierarchy of the Help system 
until topic information is reached. The hierarchical relationship of 
Help topics determines in part how the user navigates through the 
Help system. 
<p>

Helpex contains an index that lists several categories of topics. Each 
category includes a secondary index, which lists topics in the category 
as well as the topics themselves. 
Moving from the index to a topic, the user goes from the general to 
the specific. 
<p>

The hierarchical structure provides the user a point of reference 
within Help. Users are not constrained to navigating up and down the 
hierarchy; they can jump from one topic to another, moving across 
categories of topics. The effect of jumps is to obscure hierarchical 
relationships. For example, the Windows Help application contains a 
search feature that lets the user enter a keyword into a dialog box and 
search for topics associated with that keyword. The Help application 
then displays a list of titles from which to choose in accessing 
information that relates to the keyword. 
<p>

Because users often know which feature they want help with, they 
can usually find what they want faster using the search feature than 
they can by moving through the hierarchical structure. 
<p>

In addition to ordering topics hierarchically, you can order them in a 
logical sequence that suits your audience. The logical sequence, or 
browse sequence, lets the user choose the Browse button to move 
from topic to topic. Browse sequences are especially important for 
users who like to read several related topics at once, such as topics 
covering the commands on the File menu. 
<p>

Whichever structure you decide to use, try to minimize the number of 
lists that users must traverse to obtain information. Also, avoid making 
users move through many levels to reach a topic. Most Help systems 
function quite well with only two or three levels. 


<h2>Displaying context-sensitive Help topics</h2>

Windows Help supports context-sensitive Help. When written in 
conjunction with programming of the application, context-sensitive 
Help lets the user press F1 in an open menu to get help with the 
selected menu item. Alternatively, the user can press Shift-F1 and then 
click on a screen region or command to get help on that item. 
<p>

Developing context-sensitive Help requires coordination between the 
Help writer and the application programmer so that Help and the 
application pass the correct information back and forth. 
<p>

To plan for context-sensitive Help, the Help author and the 
application programmer should agree on a list of context numbers. 
Context numbers are arbitrary numbers that correspond to each menu 
command or screen region in the application and are used to create 
the links to the corresponding Help topics. You can then enter these 
numbers, along with their corresponding context-string identifiers, in 
the Help project file, which the Help Compiler uses to build a Help 
resource file. 
<p>

The context numbers assigned in the Help project file must 
correspond to the context numbers that the application sends at run-time 
to invoke a particular topic. 
<p>

If you do not explicitly assign context numbers to topics, the Help 
Compiler generates default values by converting topic context strings 
into context numbers. 
<p>

To manage context numbers and file information, you might want to 
create a Help tracker to list the context numbers for your context-sensitive 
topics. 


<h2>Determining the Topic File Structure</h2>

The Help file structure remains essentially the same for all 
applications even though the context and number of topic files differ. 
Topic files are segmented into the different topics by means of page 
breaks. When you build the Help system, the compiler uses these 
topic files to create the information displayed for the user in the 
applications Help window. 
<p>

When choosing a file structure for your Help system, consider the 
scope and content of the Help system you are planning. For example, 
you could place all Help topics in a single large topic file or place 
each Help topic in a separate file. Neither of these file structures is 
generally acceptable. An enormous single file or too many individual 
files can present difficulties during the creation of the Help resource 
file. 
<p>

The number of topics relates to the number of features covered by the 
Help system. Consequently, you cannot make extensive changes to 
one without also making changes to the other. For instance, if a 
number of additional product features is added to Help, then 
additional topics must be created to accommodate the new 
information. 


<h2>Designing the Appearance of Help Topics</h2>

How the information in the Help window appears to the user is 
primarily a function of the layout of the Help topic. The Windows 
Help application supports a number of text attributes and graphic 
images you can use to design your Help window. 
<p>

This section provides general guidelines for designing a window and 
describes fonts and graphic images that Windows Help supports. 


<h2>Layout of the Help text</h2>

Help text files are not limited to plain, unformatted text. You can use 
different fonts and point sizes, include color and graphics to 
emphasize points, present information in tables, indent paragraphs to 
present complex information, and use a variety of other visual devices 
to present your information. 
<p>

Research on screen format and Help systems has produced general 
guidelines for presenting information to users. The section 
"Additional Resources" later in this chapter lists some sources of this 
research. The following list summarizes the findings of these studies. 


<h2>Language</h2>

Use language appropriate for the audience that you have defined. 
Language that is too sophisticated for your audience can frustrate 
users by requiring them to learn the definitions of unfamiliar terms 
and concepts. Conversely, language that is overly simplistic may 
insult your readers. 


<h2>Amount of text</h2>

Use the minimum of text possible. Studies indicate that reading speed 
decreases by 30% when users read online text rather than printed text. 
Minimal, concise text helps users compensate for that decreased 
reading speed. 


<h2>Paragraph length</h2>

Use short paragraphs. Online users become overloaded with text 
more easily than do readers of printed material. Breaking text into 
short paragraphs helps avoid this problem. 


<h2>White space</h2>

Use white space to group information visually. It makes online text 
more readable. Use it liberally, while also considering the overall size 
that a topic occupies on the screen. Users tend to think there is more 
information on a screen than actually exists. For example, if the ratio 
of white space to text is 50: 50, users perceive the ratio to be 40: 60. 


<h2>Highlighting</h2>

Use highlighting judiciously. Windows Help provides a variety of 
highlighting devices such as font sizes, font types, and color. Using a 
few of these devices can help users find information quickly. Too 
many highlighted items can decrease the effectiveness of your visual 
presentation and confuse users. As with print-based documentation, 
use only one or two fonts at a time. 


<h2>Graphics and icons</h2>

Use graphics and icons to support the explanation of visual events. 
Window Help supports the use of bitmapped graphic images. Use 
appropriate images to help explain the function of icons and screen 
elements in your application. Remember that graphics draw the user's 
eye before the accompanying text. Be sure to crop your images to 
remove distracting information. Use color images only if you are 
certain that your user's systems have color capabilities. As with 
context-sensitive help, consider the additional time necessary to 
create accurate and meaningful graphic images. See the section 
"Inserting Graphic Images" later in this chapter for more information 
on placing graphics in your Help files. 


<h2>Design consistency</h2>

Be rigorously consistent in your design. Users expect the appearance 
of Help topics to be the same, regardless of the information 
presented. Consistent titling, highlighting, fonts, and positioning of 
text in the window are essential for an effective help system. 


<h2>Type fonts and sizes</h2>

The Windows Help application can display text in any font and size 
available to the system. When the topic files are passed to the build 
process, the Help Compiler attempts to use the fonts and sizes found 
in the topic files. If a font or point size cannot be matched exactly 
when the Help file is displayed by Windows Help, the closest 
available font and size on the users system is used. 
<p>

Windows ships with only certain fonts in specific font sizes. If you 
write Help files using these fonts and sizes, the displayed Help file 
closely matches the printed word-processed file. Because fonts other 
than those shipped with Windows may not be available on users 
machines, you might want to limit your font selection to the shipped 
Windows fonts. 
<p>

The fonts included with Windows are: 

<ul>
	<li> Courier 10, 12, 15 
	<li> Helvetica 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 
	<li> Modern 
	<li> Roman 
	<li> Script 
	<li> Symbol 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 
	<li> Times Roman 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 
</ul>

Since Windows Help supports any Windows font, special symbols 
such as arrows can be included in your topics by using the Symbol 
font. 


<h2>Graphic images</h2>

The Windows Help application allows you to embed graphics in the 
Help file. Graphics can be placed and displayed anywhere on the 
page. 
<p>

Color graphic images can be included, provided that you use only the 
available Windows system colors. If you use graphics tools that 
support an enhanced color palette to create or capture images, these 
images may not always display with the intended colors. And since 
you cannot control the color capabilities on a user's machine, you 
might want to limit your graphic images to black and white bitmaps. 
<p>

Keep in mind that graphics are most effective when they contribute 
to the learning process. Graphics not tied to the information are 
usually distracting rather than helpful and should be avoided. See the 
section "Inserting Graphic Images" later in this chapter for more 
information on placing graphics in your Help files.

<h2>Creating Help Topic Files</h2>

Probably the most time-consuming task in developing a Help system 
for your application is creating the Help topic files from which you 
compile the Help system. Help topic files are text files that define 
what the user sees when using the Help system. The topic files can 
define various kinds of information, such as an index to information 
on the system, a list of commands, or a description of how to 
perform a task. 
<p>

Creating topic files entails writing the text that the user sees when 
using Help and entering control codes that determine how the user 
can move from one topic to another. 
<p>

The following sections describe: 

<ul>
	<li> Choosing an authoring tool 
	<li> Structuring Help topic files 
	<li> Coding Help topic files 
</ul>

<h2>Choosing an Authoring Tool</h2>

To write your text files, you need a Rich Text Format (RTF) editor, 
which lets you create the footnotes, underlined text, and 
strikethrough or double-underlined text that indicate the control 
codes. Your choices include, but are not limited to: 


<ul>
	<li> Microsoft Word for Windows, version 1.0 or higher 
	<li> Microsoft Word for the PC, version 5.0 or higher 
	<li> Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 3.0 or 4.0 or 
	higher 
	<li> Other word processors that support RTF 
</ul>


Microsoft Word's RTF capability allows you to insert the coded text 
required to define Help terms, such as jumps, keywords, and 
definitions. If you choose an editor other than one of the Microsoft 
Word products, make sure it creates Help files that work as you 
intend. 


<h2>Structuring Help Topic Files</h2>

A Help topic file typically contains multiple Help topics. To identify 
each topic within a file: 

<ul>
	<li> Individual topics are separated by hard page breaks. 
	<li> For each topic accessible via a hypertext link, use a 
	unique identifier or context string. 
</ul>


In addition, each topic can have a(n): 

<ul>
	<li> Title 
	<li> List of keywords associated with it 
	<li> Build-tag indicator 
	<li> Assigned browse sequence 
</ul>


For information about inserting page breaks between topics, see the 
documentation for the editor you are using. For information about 
assigning context strings and titles to topics, see the following section. 


<h2>Coding Help Topic Files</h2>

The Help system uses control codes for particular purposes: 

<pre>
Table 26-1 Help system control codes 

Control code		Purpose 

Asterisk (*) footnote	Build tag: defines a tag that specifies topics 
			the compiler conditionally builds into the 
			system. Build tags are optional, but they 
			must appear first in a topic when they are 
			used. 

Pound sign (#) footnote	Context string: defines a context string that 
			uniquely identifies a topic. Because 
			hypertext relies on links provided by 
			context strings, topics without context 
			strings can be accessed only by using 
			keywords or browse sequences. 

Dollar sign ($) footnote Title: defines the title of a topic. Titles are 
			optional. 

Letter K footnote	Keyword: defines a keyword the user uses 
			to search for a topic. Keywords are 
			optional. 

Plus sign (+) footnote	Browse sequence number: defines a 
			sequence that determines the order in 
			which the user can browse through topics. 
			Browse sequences are optional. However, if 
			you omit browse sequences, the Help 
			window still includes the Browse buttons, 
			but they are grayed out. 

Strikethrough		Cross-reference: indicates the text the user 
			can choose to jump to another topic. 

Underlined text		Definition: specifies that a temporary or 
			look-up box be displayed when the user 
			holds down the mouse button or Enter key. 
			The box can include such information as 
			the definition of a word or phrase, or a hint 
			about a procedure. 

Hidden text		Cross-reference context string: specifies the 
			context string for the topic that is displayed 
			when the user chooses the text that 
			immediately precedes it. 
</pre>

If you are using build tags, footnote them at the very beginning of the 
topic. Place other footnotes in any order you want. For information 
about assigning specific control codes, see the following sections. 


<h2>Assigning build tags</h2>

Build tags are strings that you assign to a topic to conditionally 
include or exclude that topic from a build. Each topic can have one 
or more build tags. Build tags are not a necessary component of your 
Help system. However, they do provide a means of supporting 
different versions of a Help system without having to create different 
source files for each version. Topics without build tags are always 
included in a build. 
<p>

You insert build tags as footnotes using the asterisk (*). When you 
assign a build tag footnote to a topic, the compiler includes or 
excludes the topic according to build information specified in the 
BUILD option and [BuildTags] section of the Help project file. For 
information about the BUILD option, the [BuildTags] section and 
the Help project file, see "Specifying build tags: the BuildTags section" 
and "Specifying build topics: the Build option" in the section 
"Creating the Help Project File" in this chapter. 
<p>

To assign a build tag to a topic: 

<ol>
	<li> Place the cursor at the beginning of the topic heading 
	line, so that it appears before all other footnotes for that 
	topic. 

	<li> Insert the asterisk (*) as a footnote reference mark. 
	Note that a superscript asterisk ( * ) appears next to the 
	heading. 

	<li> Type the build tag name as the footnote. 

	<li> Be sure to allow only a single space between the asterisk 
	and the build tag. 
</ol>

Build tags can be made up of any alphanumeric characters. The build 
tag is not case sensitive. The tag may not contain spaces. You can 
specify multiple build tags by separating them with a semicolon, as in 
the following example: 

<pre>
	* AppVersion1; AppVersion2; Test_Build 
</pre>

Including a build tag footnote with a topic is equivalent to setting the 
tag to true when compared to the value set in the project file. The 
compiler assumes all other build tags to be false for that topic. After 
setting the truth value of the build tag footnotes, the compiler 
evaluates the build expression in the Options section of the Help 
project file. Note that all build tags must be declared in the project file, 
regardless of whether a given conditional compilation declares the 
tags. If the evaluation results in a true state, the compiler includes the 
topic in the build. Otherwise, the compiler omits the topic. 
<p>

The compiler includes in all builds all the topics that do not have a 
build tag footnote regardless of the build tag expressions defined in 
the Help project file. For this reason, you may want to use build tags 
primarily to exclude specific topics from certain builds. If the compiler 
finds any build tags not declared in the Help project file, it displays 
an error message.
<p>

By allowing conditional inclusion and exclusion of specific topics, 
you can create multiple builds using the same topic files. This saves 
time and effort for the Help development team. It also means that you 
can develop Help topics that help you maintain a higher level of 
consistency across your product lines. 


<h2>Assigning context strings</h2>

Context strings identify each topic in the Help system. Each context 
string must be unique. A given context string may be assigned to only 
one topic within the Help project; it cannot be used for any other 
topic. 
<p>

The context string provides the means to create jumps between topics 
or to display look-up boxes, such as word and phrase definitions. 
Although not required, most topics in the Help system have context-string 
identifiers, Topics without context strings may not be accessed 
through hypertext jumps. However, topics without context-string 
identifiers can be accessed through browse sequences or keyword 
searches, if desired. It is up to the Help writer to justify the authoring 
of topics that can be accessed only in these manners. For information 
about assigning jumps, see the section "Creating cross-references 
between topics" later in this chapter. For information about assigning 
browse sequences, see the section "Assigning browse sequence 
numbers" later in this chapter. For information about assigning 
keywords, see the section "Assigning keywords" later in this chapter. 
<p>

To assign a context string to a Help topic: 

<ol>
	<li> Place the cursor to the left of the topic heading. 

	<li> Insert the pound sign (#) as the footnote reference mark. 
	Note that a superscript pound sign ( # ) appears next to the 
	heading. 

	<li> Type the context string as the footnote. 

	<li> Be sure to allow only a single space between the pound 
	sign and the string. Context strings are not case sensitive. 
</ol>

Valid context strings may contain the alphabetic characters A - Z, the 
numeric characters 0 - 9 and the period (.) and underscore (_) 
characters. The following example shows the context string footnote 
that identifies a topic called Opening an Existing Text File: 

<pre>
	#OpeningExistingTextFile 
</pre>

Although a context string has a practical limitation of about 255 
characters, there is no good reason for approaching this value. Keep 
the strings sensible and short so that they're easier to enter into the 
text files. 


<h2>Assigning titles</h2>

Within the Help system, title footnotes perform the following 
functions: 

<ul>
	<li> Appear on the Bookmark menu. 

	<li> Appear in the Topics found list that results from a 
	keyword search. (Topics that do not have titles, but are 
	accessible via keywords, are listed as &gt;&gt; Untitled Topic&lt;&lt; 
	in the Topics found list.) 
</ul>


Although not required, most topics have a title. You might not assign 
a title to topics containing low-level information that Help's search 
feature, look-up boxes, and system messages do not access. 
<p>


To assign a title to a topic: 

<ol>
	<li> Place the cursor to the left of the topic heading. 

	<li> Insert a footnote with a dollar sign ($) as the footnote 
	reference mark. 

	Note that a superscript dollar sign ( $ ) appears next to the 
	heading. 

	<li> Type the title as the footnote. 

	Be sure to allow only a single space between the dollar 
	sign ($) and the title. 
</ol>

The following is an example of a footnote that defines the title for a 
topic: 

<pre>
	$ Help Keys 
</pre>

When adding titles, keep in mind the following restrictions: 

<pre>
	Item	Restrictions 

	Characters
		Title can be up to 128 characters in length. The 
		Help compiler truncates title strings longer than 
		128 characters. When the user searches for a 
		keyword or enters a bookmark, the Help system 
		displays titles in a list box. 

	Formatting
		Title footnote entries cannot be formatted. 
</pre>

<h2>Assigning keywords</h2>

Help allows the user to search for topics with the use of keywords 
assigned to the topics. When the user searches for a topic by 
keyword, Help matches the user-entered word to keywords assigned 
to specific topics. Help then lists matching topics by their titles in the 
Search dialog box. Because a keyword search is often a fast way for 
users to access Help topics, you probably want to assign keywords to 
most topics in your Help system. 
<p>

<h4>Note:</h4>
 
	You should specify a keyword footnote only if the 
	topic has a title footnote, since the title of the topic 
	appears in the search dialog when the user searches 
	for the keyword. 
<p>

To assign a keyword to a topic: 

<ol>
	<li> Place the cursor to the left of the topic heading. 

	<li> Insert an uppercase K as the footnote reference mark. 
	Note that a superscript K(K) appears next to the heading. 

	<li> Type the keyword, or keywords, as the footnote. 
	Be sure to allow only a single space between the K and 
	the first keyword. 
	<p>

	If you add more than one keyword, separate each with a 
	semicolon. 
</ol>

The following is an example of keywords for a topic: 

<pre>
	K open; opening; text file; ASCII; existing;
	   text only; documents; 
</pre>

Whenever the user performs a search on any of these keywords, the 
corresponding titles appear in a list box. More than one topic may 
have the same keyword. 
<p>

When adding keywords, keep in mind the following restrictions: 

<pre>
	Table 26-2 Keyword restrictions 

	Item	Restrictions 

	Characters
		Keywords can include any ANSI character, 
		including accented characters. The 
		maximum length for keywords is 255 
		characters. A space embedded in a keyword 
		is considered a character, permitting phrases 
		to be keywords. 

	Phrases
		Help searches for any word in the specified 
		phrase. 


	Formatting
		Keywords are not formatted. 

	Case sensitivity
		Keywords are not case sensitive. 

	Punctuation
		Except for semicolon delimiters, you can 
		use punctuation. 
</pre>

<h2>Creating multiple keyword tables</h2>

Multiple keyword tables are useful in allowing a program to look up 
topics defined in alternate keyword tables. You can use an additional 
keyword table to allow users familiar with keywords in a different 
application to identify the matching keywords in your application. 
<p>

Authoring additional keyword tables is a two-part process. First, the 
MULTIKEY option must be placed in the [Options] section of the 
project file. 
<p>

Second, the topics to be associated with the additional keyword table 
must be authored and labeled. Footnotes are assigned in the same 
manner as are normal keyword footnotes, except that the letter 
specified with the MULTIKEY option is used. With this version of the 
Help Compiler, the keyword footnote used is case sensitive. 
Therefore, care should be taken to use the same case, usually 
uppercase, for your keyword footnote. Be sure to associate only one 
topic with a keyword. Help does not display the normal search dialog 
box for a multiple keyword search. Instead it displays the first topic 
found with the specified keyword. If you want the topics in your 
additional keyword table to appear in the normal Help keyword table, 
you must also specify a K footnote and the given keyword. 
<p>

The application for which you are developing Help can then display 
the Help topic associated with a given string in a specified keyword 
table. Keywords are sorted without regard to case for the keyword 
table. 


<h2>Assigning browse sequence numbers</h2>

In this version of Help, topics defined in browse sequences are 
accessed using the Browse buttons at the top of the Help window. 
Future versions of Help will not normally display browse buttons for 
the user. However, if your Help resource file includes browse 
sequences authored in the format described here, these versions will 
support the feature by automatically displaying browse buttons for 
the user. 
<p>

A browse sequence is determined by sequence numbers, established 
by the Help writer. 
<p>

To build browse sequences into the Help topics, the writer must: 

<ol>
	<li> Decide which topics should be grouped together and 
	what order they should follow when viewed as a group. 
	Help supports multiple, discontiguous sequence lists. 

	<li> Code topics to implement the sequence. 
</ol>

<h2>Organizing browse sequences</h2>

When organizing browse sequences, the writer must arrange the 
topics in an order that makes sense to the user. Topics can be 
arranged in alphabetical order within a subject, in order of difficulty, 
or in a sensible order that seems natural to the application. The 
following example illustrates browse sequences for the menu 
commands used in a given application. The Help writer subjectively 
defines the order that makes the most sense from a procedural point 
of view. You may, of course, choose a different order. 

<pre>
SampleApp Commands
    File Menu - commands: 005 
	New Command - file_menu: 005
	Open Command - file_menu: 010 
	Save Command - file_menu: 015
	Save As Command - file_menu: 020 
	Print Command - file_menu: 025
	Printer Setup Command - file_menu: 030 
	Exit Command - file_menu: 035 


    Edit Menu - commands: 010
	Undo Command - edit_menu: 025 
	Cut Command - edit_menu: 015
	Copy Command - edit_menu: 010 
	Paste Command - edit_menu: 020
	Clear Command - edit_menu: 005 
	Select All Command - edit_menu: 030
	Word Wrap Command - edit_menu: 035 
	Type Face Command - edit_menu: 040
	Point Size Command - edit_menu: 045 
    Search Menu - commands: 015
	Find Command - search_menu: 005 
	Find Next Command - search_menu: 010
	Previous Command - search_menu: 015 
    Window Menu - commands: 020
	Tile Command - window_menu: 005 
	Cascade Command - window_menu: 010
	Arrange Icons Command - window_menu: 015 
	Close All Command - window_menu: 020
	Document Name Command - window_menu: 025 


Each line consists of a sequence list name followed by a colon and a 
sequence number. The sequence list name is optional. If the 
sequence does not have a list name, as in the following example, the 
compiler places the topic in a null list: 

	Window Menu -120 

Note that the numbers used in the browse sequence example begin 
at 005 and advance in increments of 005. Generally, it is good practice 
to skip one or more numbers in a sequence so you can add new 
topics later if necessary. Skipped numbers are of no consequence to 
the Help Compiler; only their order is significant. 

Sequence numbers establish the order of topics within a browse 
sequence list. Sequence numbers can consist of any alphanumeric 
characters. During the compiling process, strings are sorted using the 
ASCII sorting technique, not a numeric sort. 


Both the alphabetic and numeric portions of a sequence can be 
several characters long; however, their lengths should be consistent 
throughout all topic files. If you use only numbers in the strings, make 
sure the strings are all the same length; otherwise, a higher sequence 
number could appear before a lower one in certain cases. For 
example, the number 100 is numerically higher than 99, but 100 
appears before 99 in the sort used by Help, because Help is 
comparing the first two digits in the strings. To keep the topics in their 
correct numeric order, you would have to make 99 a three-digit 
string: 099. 


<h2>Coding browse sequences</h2>

After determining how to group and order topics, code the sequence 
by assigning the appropriate sequence list name and number to each 
topic, as follows: 


	1. Place the cursor to the left of the topic heading. 

	2. Insert the plus sign (+) as the footnote reference mark. 
	Note that a superscript plus sign ( + ) appears next to the 
	heading. 

	3. Type the sequence number using alphanumeric 
	characters. 


For example, the following footnote defines the browse sequence 
number for the Edit menu topic in the previous browse sequence 
example: 


	+ commands: 010 

While it may be easier to list topics within the file in the same order 
that they appear in a browse sequence, it is not necessary. The 
compiler orders the sequence for you. 


<h2>Creating cross-references between topics</h2>

Cross-references, or jumps, are specially coded words or phrases that 
are linked to other topics. Although you indicate jump terms with 
strikethrough or double-underlined text in the topic file, they appear 
underlined in the Help window. In addition, jump terms appear in 
color on color systems. For example, the strikethrough text (double-underlined 
in Word for Windows) New Command appears as New 
Command in green text to the user. 


To code a word or phrase as a jump in the topic file: 

	1. Place the cursor at the point in the text where you want 
	to enter the jump term. 

	2. Select the strikethrough (or double-underline) feature of 
	your editor. 

	3. Type the jump word or words in strikethrough mode. 

	4. Turn off strikethrough and select the editor's hidden-text 
	feature. 

	5. Type the context string assigned to the topic that is the 
	target of the jump. 


When coding jumps, keep in mind that: 

<ul>
	<li> No spaces can occur between the strikethrough (or 
	double-underlined) text and the hidden text. 

	<li> Coded spaces before or after the jump term are not 
	permitted. 

	<li> Paragraph marks must be entered as plain text. 
</ul>


<h2>Defining terms</h2>

Most topic files contain words or phrases that require further 
definition. To get the definition of a word or phrase, the user first 
selects the word and then holds down the mouse button or Enter key, 
causing the definition to appear in a box within the Help window. 
The Help writer decides which words to define, considering the 
audience that will be using the application and which terms might 
already be familiar. 

Note 

	The look-up feature need not be limited to 
	definitions. With the capability to temporarily 
	display information in a box, you might want to 
	show a hint about a procedure or other suitable 
	information for the user. 


Defining a term requires that you: 

<ul>
	<li> Create a topic that defines the term. The definition topic 
	must include a context string. 

	<li> Provide a cross-reference for the definition topic 
	whenever the term occurs. 
</ul>


You don't need to define the same word multiple times in the same 
topic, just at its first occurrence. Also, consider the amount of 
colored text you are creating in the Help window. See "Coding 
definitions," below. 


<h2>Creating definition topics</h2>

You can organize definition topics any way you want. For example, 
include each definition topic in the topic file that mentions the term. 
Or organize all definitions in one topic file and provide the user with 
direct access to it. Organizing definition topics into one file provides 
you with a glossary and lets you make changes easily. 


<h2>Coding definitions</h2>

After creating definition topics, code the terms as they occur, as 
follows: 

	1. Designate the insertion point where you want to place the 
	term that requires definition. 

	2. Select the underline feature of your editor. 

	3. Type the term. 

	4. Turn off the underline feature, and select the editor's 
	hidden-text feature. 

	5. Type the context string assigned to the topic that contains 
	the definition of the term. 

<h2>Inserting Graphic Images</h2>

Bitmapped graphic images can be placed in Help topics using either 
of two methods. If your word processor supports the placement of 
Windows format graphics directly into a document, you can simply 
paste your bitmaps into each topic file. Alternatively, you can save 
each bitmap in a separate file and specify the file by name where 
you want it to appear in the Help topic file. The latter method of 
placing graphics is referred to as bitmaps by reference. The 
following sections describe the process of placing bitmaps directly or 
by reference into your Help topics. 


<h2>Creating and capturing bitmaps</h2>

You can create your bitmaps using any graphical tools, as long as the 
resulting images can be displayed in the Windows environment. Each 
graphic image can then be copied to the Windows clipboard. Once 
on the clipboard, a graphic can be pasted into a graphics editor such 
as Paint, and modified or cleaned up as needed. 


Windows Help 3.0 or higher supports color bitmaps. However, for 
future compatibility, you might want to limit graphics to monochrome 
format. If you are producing monochrome images, you might have to 
adjust manually to either black, white, or a pattern of black and white 
pixels the elements of your source graphic that were originally 
different colors. 


When you are satisfied with the appearance of your bitmap, you can 
either save it as a file, to be used as a bitmap by reference, or you can 
copy it onto the clipboard and paste it into your word processor. If 
you save the graphic as a file, be sure first to specify its size in your 
graphics editor, so that only the area of interest is saved for display in 
the Help window. The tighter you crop your images, the more closely 
you can position text next to the image. Always save (or convert and 
save if necessary) graphics in Windows .BMP format. 


Bitmap images should be created in the same screen mode that you 
intend Help to use when topics are displayed. If your Help files are 
displayed in a different mode, bitmaps might not retain the same 
aspect ratio or information as their source images. 


<h2>Placing bitmaps using a graphical word processor</h2>

The easiest way to precisely place bitmaps into Help topics is to use 
a graphical word processor. Word for Windows supports the direct 
importation of bitmaps from the clipboard. Simply paste the graphic 
image where you want it to appear in the Help topic. You can format 
your text so that it is positioned below or alongside the bitmap. When 
you save your Help topic file in RTF, the pasted-in bitmap is 
converted as well and is automatically included in the Help resource 
file. 


<h2>Placing bitmaps by reference</h2>

If your word processor cannot import and display bitmaps directly, 
you can specify the location of a bitmap that you have saved as a file. 
To insert a bitmap reference in the Help topic file, insert one of the 
following statements where you want the bitmap to appear in the 
topic: 


	{bmc filename.bmp}
	{bml filename.bmp} 
	{bmr filename.bmp} 


Note 
	Do not specify a full path for filename. If you need 
	to direct the compiler to a bitmap in a location other 
	than the root directory for the build, specify the 
	absolute path for the bitmap in the [Bitmaps] 
	section of the project file. 


The argument bmc stands for bitmap character, indicating that the 
bitmap referred to is treated the same as a character placed in the 
topic file at the same location on a line. Text can precede or follow 
the bitmap on the same line, and line spacing is determined based 
upon the size of the characters (including the bitmap character) on 
the line. Do not specify negative line spacing for a paragraph with a 
bitmap image, or the image may inadvertently overwrite text above it 
when it is displayed in Help. When you use the argument bmc, there 
is no automatic text wrapping around the graphic image. Text follows 
the bitmap, positioned at the baseline. 


The argument bml specifies that the bitmap appear at the left margin, 
with text wrapping automatically along the right edge of the image. 
The argument bmr specifies that the bitmap appear at the right 
margin, with text to its left. Bitmap filenames must be the same as 
those listed in the [Bitmaps] section of the Help project file. 

Note 
	Multiple references to a bitmap of the same name 
	refer to the same bitmap when the Help file is 
	displayed. This means that bitmap references can be 
	repeated in your Help system without markedly 
	increasing the size of the Help resource file. 


<h2>Managing Topic Files</h2>

Help topic files can be saved in the default word-processor format or 
in RTF. If you always save your files in RTF and later need to make a 
change, the word processor, as it reloads the file, may take additional 
time to interpret the format. If you anticipate making numerous 
changes during Help development, you might want to minimize this 
delay by saving topic files in both default and RTF formats, with 
different file extensions to distinguish them. The compiler needs only 
the RTF files, and you have faster access to the source files for 
changes. On a large project, this practice can save a considerable 
amount of development time. 


It's important to keep track of all topic files for the following reasons: 

<ul>
	<li> To ensure that no topics are left out of the build process 

	<li> To ensure that each topic has been assigned a unique 
	context string 

	<li> To double-check browse sequencing within general and 
	specific lists 

	<li> To show keyword and title matches 

	<li> To allow writers to see where the text for each of the 
	topics is located 

	<li> To keep track of changes to files and the current status 

	<li> To track any other aspect of the Help development 
	process that you think essential 
</ul>


At a minimum, writers must keep track of their own topic files and 
must pass the filenames to the person who is responsible for creating 
the Help project file. 

<h2>Building the Help File</h2>

After the topic files for your Help system have been written, you are 
ready to create a Help project file and run a build to test the Help 
file. The Help project file contains all information the compiler needs 
to convert help topic files into a binary Help resource file. 


You use the Help project file to tell the Help Compiler which topic 
files to include in the build process. Information in the Help project 
file also enables the compiler to map specific topics to context 
numbers (for the context-sensitive portion of Help). 


After you compile your Help file, the development team programs the 
application so the user can access it. 


The remainder of this chapter describes the following: 

<ul>
	<li> Creating a Help project file 
	<li> Compiling the Help file 
	<li> Programming the application to access Help 
	<li> Help compiler error messages 
</ul>


<h2>Creating the Help Project File</h2>

Use the Help project file to control how the Help Compiler builds 
your topic files. The Help project file can contain up to six sections 
that perform the following functions: 


	Table 26-3 Sections of a Help project file 

	Section Function 

	[Files]
		Specifies topic files to be included in the build. 
		This section is mandatory. 

	[Options]
		Specifies the level of error reporting, topics to be 
		included in the build, the directory in which to 
		find the files, and the location of your Help index. 
		This section is optional. 

	[BuildTags]
		Specifies valid build tags. This section is optional. 

	[Alias]
		Assigns one or more context strings to the same 
		topic. This section is optional. 

	[Map]
		Associates context strings with context numbers. 
		This section is optional. 


	[Bitmaps]
		Specifies bitmap files to be included in the build. 
		This section is optional. 


You can use any ASCII text editor to create your Help project file. The 
extension of a Help project file is .hpj. If you do not use the 
extension .hpj on the HC command line, the compiler looks for a 
project file with this extension before loading the file. The .hlp 
output file has the same name as the .hpj file. 


The order of the various sections within the Help project file is 
arbitrary, with one exception: under all circumstances, if an [Alias] 
section is used, it must precede the [Map] section. 


Section names are placed within brackets using the following syntax: 

	[section-name] 

You can use a semicolon to indicate a comment in the project file. 
The compiler ignores all text from the semicolon to the end of the line 
on which it occurs. 


<h2>Specifying topic files: the Files section</h2>

Use the [Files] section of the Help project file to list all topic files 
that the Help Compiler should process to produce a Help resource 
file. A Help project file must have a [Files] section. 


The following sample shows the format of the [Files] section: 

	[FILES] 
	HELPEX.RTF; Main topics for HelpEx application 
	TERMS.RTF; Lookup terms for HelpEx appliction 

Using the path defined in the ROOT option, the Help Compiler finds 
and processes all files listed in this section of the Help project file. If 
the file is not on the defined path and cannot be found, the compiler 
generates an error. For more information about the ROOT option, see 
the section "Specifying the root directory: the Root option" later in this 
chapter. 


You can include files in the build process using the C #include 
directive command. 

The #include directive uses the following syntax: 

	#include &lt;filename&gt; 

You must include the angle brackets around the filename. The pound 
sign (#) must be the first character in the line. The filename must 
specify a complete path, either the path defined by the ROOT option 
or an absolute directory path to the file. 


You may find it easier to create a text file that lists all files in the Help 
project and include that file in the build, as in this example: 


	[FILES] #include &lt;hlpfiles.inc&gt; 

<h2>Specifying build tags: the BuildTags section</h2>

If you code build tags in your topic files, use the [BuildTags] 
section of the Help project file to define all the valid build tags for a 
particular Help project. The [BuildTags] section is optional. 


The following example shows the format of the [BuildTags] 
section in a sample Help project file: 


	[BUILDTAGS] 
	WINENV; topics to include in Windows build 
	DEBUGBUILD; topics to include in debugging build 
	TESTBUILD; topics to include in testing build 


The [BuildTags] section can include up to 30 build tags. The build 
tags are not case sensitive and may not contain space characters. Only 
one build tag is allowed per line in this section. The compiler 
generates an error message if anything other than a comment is listed 
after a build tag in the [BuildTags] section. 


<h2>Specifying options: the Options section</h2>

Use the [Options] section of the Help project file to specify the 
following options: 

	Table 26-4 Help project file options 

	Option Meaning 

	BUILD
		Determines what topics the compiler includes 
		in the build 

	COMPRESS
		Specifies the compression of the Help resource 
		file 

	FORCEFONT
		Specifies the creation of a Help resource file 
		using only one font 

	INDEX
		Specifies the context string of the Help index 

	MAPFONTSIZE
		Determines the mapping of specified font sizes 
		to different sizes 

	MULTIKEY
		Specifies alternate keyword mapping for topics 

	ROOT
		Designates the directory to be used for the 
		Help build 

	TITLE
		Specifies the title shown for the Help system 

	WARNING
		Indicates the kind of error message the 
		compiler reports 

These options can appear in any order within the [Options] 
section. The [Options] section is not required. 


Detailed explanations of the available options follow. 


<h2>Specifying error reporting: the Warning option</h2>

Use the WARNING option to specify the amount of debugging 
information that the compiler reports. The WARNING option has the 
following syntax: 

	WARNING = level 


You can set the WARNING option to any of the following levels: 

	Table 26-5 Warning option levels 
	Level Information reported 

	1 Only the most severe warnings. 
	2 An intermediate level of warnings. 
	3 All warnings. This is the default level. 

The following example specifies an intermediate level of error 
reporting: 

	[OPTIONS] WARNING= 2 

The compiler reports errors to the standard output file, typically the 
screen. You may want to redirect the errors to a disk file so that you 
can browse it when you are debugging the Help system. The 
following example shows the redirection of compiler screen output 
to a file. 


	HC HELPEX &gt;errors.out 


Warning
	Use the DOS CONTROL+PRINT SCREEN accelerator 
	key before you begin your compilation to echo 
	errors that appear on the screen to your printer. 
	Press CONTROL+PRINT SCREEN again to stop 
	sending information to the printer. 


<h2>Specifying build topics: the Build option</h2>

If you have included build tags in your topic files, use the BUILD 
option to specify which topics to conditionally include in the build. If 
your topic files have no build tags, omit the BUILD option from the 
[Options] section. 


Note 
	All build tags must be listed in the [BuildTags] 
	section of the project file, regardless of whether a 
	given conditional compilation declares the tags. 


See the section "Creating Help Topic Files" later in this chapter for 
information on assigning build tags to topics in the Help topic files. 


The BUILD option line uses the following syntax: 

	BUILD = expression 

BUILD expressions cannot exceed 255 characters in length and must 
be entered on only one line. BUILD expressions use Boolean logic to 
specify which topics within the specified Help topic files the compiler 
includes in the build. The tokens of the language are: 

	Token Description 
	&lt;tag&gt; Build tag 
	() Parentheses 
	&amp; AND operator 
	| OR operator 
	~ NOT operator 

The compiler evaluates all build expressions from left to right. The 
operators have the following precedence: 

	1. () 
	2. ~ 
	3. &amp; 
	4. | 

For example, if you code build tags called WINENV, APP1, and 
TEST_BUILD in your topic files, you can include one of the following 
build expressions in the [Options] section: 


	Table 26-6 Examples of build expressions 

	Build expression
		Topics built 

	BUILD = WINENV
		Only topics that have the 
		WINENV tag 

	BUILD = WINENV &amp; APP1
		Topics that have both the 
		WINENV and APP1 tags 

	BUILD = WINENV | APP1
		Topics that have either the 
		WINENV tag or the APP1 tag 

	BUILD = ~APP1
		Topics that do not have a APP1 
		tag 

<h2>Specifying the root directory: the Root option</h2>

Use the ROOT option to designate the root directory of the Help 
project. The compiler searches for files in the specified root directory. 

The ROOT option uses the following syntax: 

	ROOT = pathname 

For example, the following root option specifies that the root 
directory is \BUILD\TEST on drive D: 

	[OPTIONS] ROOT= D:\BUILD\TEST 

The ROOT option allows you to refer to all relative paths off the root 
directory of the Help project. For example, the following entry in the 
[Files] section refers to a relative path off the root directory: 

	TOPICS\FILE.RTF 

To refer to a file in a fixed location, independent of the project root, 
you must specify a fully qualified or absolute path, including a drive 
letter, if necessary, as in the following line: 

	D:\HELPTEST\TESTFILE.RTF 

If you do not include the ROOT option in your Help project file, all 
paths are relative to the current DOS directory. 


<h2>Specifying the index: the Index option</h2>

Use the INDEX option to identify the context string of the Help index. 
Because the Index button gives the user access to the index from 
anywhere in the Help system, you probably do not want to author 
terms to jump to the index. Users access this general index either from 
the Help menu of the application or by choosing the Index button 
from the Help window. 


Assigning a context string to the index topic in the [Options] 
section lets the compiler know the location of the main index of Help 
topics for the applications Help file. If you do not include the INDEX 
option in the [Options] section, the compiler assumes that the first 
topic it encounters is the index. 


The INDEX option uses the following syntax: 

	INDEX = context-string 

The context string specified must match the context string you assign 
to the Help index topic. In the following example, the writer informs 
the compiler that the context string of the Help index is 
main_ index: 

	[OPTIONS] INDEX = main_ index 

For information about assigning context strings, see the section 
"Assigning context strings" earlier in this chapter. 


<h2>Assigning a title to the Help system: the Title option</h2>

You can assign a title to your Help system with the TITLE option. 
The title appears in the title bar of the Help window with the word 
"Help" automatically appended, followed by the DOS filename of the 
Help resource file. 


The TITLE option uses the following syntax: 

	TITLE = Help-system-title-name 

Titles are limited to 32 characters in length. If you do not specify a 
title using the TITLE option, only the word "Help" followed by the 
Help system filename is displayed in the title bar. Because the 
compiler always inserts the word "Help," you should keep in mind 
not to duplicate it in your title. 


<h2>Converting fonts: the FORCEFONT option</h2>

You can use the FORCEFONT option to create a Help resource file that 
is made up of only one typeface or font. This is useful if you must 
compile a Help system using topic files that include fonts not 
supported by your users' systems. 


The FORCEFONT option uses the following syntax: 

	FORCEFONT = fontname 

The fontname parameter is any Windows system font. Windows ships 
with the following fonts and sizes: 

<ul>
	<li> Courier 10, 12, 15 
	<li> Helvetica 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 
	<li> Modern 
	<li> Roman 
	<li> Script 
	<li> Symbol 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 
	<li> Times Roman 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 
</ul>


Font names must be spelled the same as they are in the Fonts dialog 
box in the Control Panel. Font names do not exceed 20 characters in 
length. If you designate a font that is not recognized by the compiler, 
an error message is generated and the compilation continues using 
the default Helvetica font. 


Note 
	The fontname used in the FORCEFONT option 
	cannot contain spaces. Therefore, Times Roman 
	font cannot be used with FORCEFONT. 


<h2>Changing font sizes: the MAPFONTSIZE option</h2>

The font sizes specified in your topic files can be mapped to different 
sizes using the MAPFONTSIZE option. In this manner, you can create 
and edit text in a size chosen for easier viewing in the topic files and 
have it sized by the compiler for the actual Help display. This may be 
useful if there is a large size difference between your authoring 
monitor and your intended display monitor. 


The MAPFONTSIZE option uses the following syntax: 

	MAPFONTSIZE = m[-n]:p 

The m parameter is the size of the source font, and the p parameter 
is the size of the desired font for the Help resource file. All fonts in 
the topic files that are size m are changed to size p. The optional 
parameter n allows you to specify a font range to be mapped. All 
fonts in the topic files falling between m and n, inclusive, are 
changed to size p. The following examples illustrate the use of the 
MAPFONTSIZE option: 


	MAPFONTSIZE=12-24:16	;make fonts from 12 to 24 as size 16 
	MAPFONTSIZE=8:12	;make all size 8 fonts as size 12. 


Note that you can map only one font size or range with each 
MAPFONTSIZE statement used in the Options section. If you use 
more than one MAPFONTSIZE statement, the source font size or 
range specified in subsequent statements cannot overlap previous 
mappings. For instance, the following mappings generate an error 
when the compiler encounters the second statement: 

	MAPFONTSIZE=12-24:16 MAPFONTSIZE=14:20
 
Because the second mapping shown in the first example contains a 
size already mapped in the preceding statement, the compiler ignores 
the line. A maximum of five font ranges can be specified in the project 
file. 


<h2>Multiple keyword tables: the MULTIKEY option</h2>

The MULTIKEY option specifies a character to be used for an 
additional keyword table. 

The MULTIKEY option uses the following syntax: 

	MULTIKEY = footnote-character 

The footnote-character parameter is the case-sensitive letter to be 
used for the keyword footnote. The following example illustrates the 
enabling of the letter L for a keyword-table footnote: 

	MULTIKEY=L 


Note 
	You must be sure to limit your keyword-table 
	footnotes to one case, usually uppercase. In the 
	previous example, topics with the footnote L would 
	have their keywords incorporated into the 
	additional keyword table, whereas those assigned 
	the letter l would not. 


You may use any alphanumeric character for a keyword table except 
K and k which are reserved for Help's normal keyword table. There 
is an absolute limit of five keyword tables, including the normal table. 
However, depending upon system configuration and the structure of 
your Help system, a practical limit of only two or three may actually 
be the case. If the compiler cannot create an additional table, the 
excess table is ignored in the build. 


<h2>Compressing the file: the Compress option</h2>

You can use the COMPRESS option to reduce the size of the Help 
resource file created by the compiler. The amount of file compression 
realized varies according to the number, size, and complexity of 
topics that are compiled. In general, the larger the Help files, the more 
they can be compressed. 


The COMPRESS option uses the following syntax: 

	COMPRESS = TRUE | FALSE 

Because the Help application can load compressed files quickly, there 
is a clear advantage in creating and shipping compressed Help files 
with your application. Compiling with compression turned on, 
however, may increase the compile time, because of the additional 
time required to assemble and sort a key-phrase table. Thus, you may 
want to compile without compression in the early stages of a project. 


The COMPRESS option causes the compiler to compress the system 
by combining repeated phrases within the source file( s). The 
compiler creates a phrase-table file with the .ph extension if it does 
not find one in existence. If the compiler finds a file with the .ph 
extension, it uses the file for the current compilation. This speeds 
compression when not a lot of text has changed since the last 
compilation. 


Deleting the key-phrase file before each compilation prevents the 
compiler from using the previous file. Maximum compression results 
only by forcing the compiler to create a new phrase table. 


<h2>Specifying alternate context strings: the Alias section</h2>

Use the [Alias] section to assign one or more context strings to the 
same topic alias. Because context strings must be unique for each 
topic and cannot be used for any other topic in the Help project, the 
[Alias] section provides a way to delete or combine Help topics 
without recoding your files. The [Alias] section is optional. 
For example, if you create a topic that replaces the information in 
three other topics and you delete the three, you have to search 
through your files for invalid cross-references to the deleted topics. 
You can avoid this problem by using the [Alias] section to assign 
the name of the new topic to the deleted topics. The [Alias] 
section can also be used when your application program has multiple 
context identifiers for which you have only one topic. This can be the 
case with context-sensitive Help. 


Each expression in the [Alias] section has the following format: 

	context_string=alias 

In the alias expression, the alias parameter is the alternate string, 
or alias name, and the context_ string parameter is the context 
string identifying a particular topic. An alias string has the same format 
and follows the same conventions as the topic context string. That is, 
it is not case sensitive and may contain the alphabetic characters A-Z, 
numeric characters 0-9, and the period and underscore characters. 


The following example illustrates an [Alias] section: 

	[ALIAS] 
	sm_key=key_shrtcuts 
	cc_key=key_shrtcuts 
	st_key=key_shrtcuts 
	;combine as keyboard shortcuts topic 


	clskey=us_dlog_bxs 
	maakey=us_dlog_bxs 
	;covered in using dialog boxes topic 


	chk_key=dlogprts 
	drp_key=dlogprts 
	lst_key=dlogprts 
	opt_key=dlogprts 
	tbx_key=dlogprts 
	;combine as parts of dialog box topic 


	frmtxt=edittxt 
	wrptxt=edittxt 
	seltxt=edittxt 
	;covered in editing text topic 

You can use alias names in the [Map] section of the Help project file. 
If you do, however, the [Alias] section must precede the [Map] 
section. 


<h2>Mapping context-sensitive topics: the Map section</h2>

If your Help system supports context-sensitive Help, use the [Map] 
section to associate either context strings or aliases to context 
numbers. The context number corresponds to a value the parent 
application passes to the Help application to display a particular 
topic. This section is optional. 


When writing the [Map] section, you can do the following: 

<ul>
	<li> Use either decimal or hexadecimal numbers formatted in 
	standard C notation to specify context numbers. 

	<li> Assign no more than one context number to a context 
	string or alias. 

	Note: Assigning the same number to more than one 
	context string generates a compiler error. 

	<li> Separate context numbers and context strings by an 
	arbitrary amount of white space using either space 
	characters or tabs. 
</ul>


You can use the C #include directive to include other files in the 
mapping. In addition, the Map section supports an extended format 
that lets you directly include C files with the .h extension. Entries 
using this format must begin with the #define directive and may 
contain comments in C format, as in this example: 


	#define context_string context_number /* comment*/ 


The following example illustrates several formats you can use in the 
[Map] section: 

	[MAP] 
    (1) 
	Edit_Window0x0001 
	Control_Menu0x0002 
	Maximize_Icon0x0003 
	Minimize_Icon0x0004 
	Split_Bar 0x0005 
	Scroll_Bar 0x0006 
	Title_Bar 0x0007 
	Window_Border0x0008 


    (2) 
	dcmb_scr30 ; Document Control-menu Icon 
	dmxi_scr31 ; Document Maximize Icon 
	dmni_scr32 ; Document Minimize Icon 
	dri_scr33 ; Document Restore Icon 
	dtb_scr34 ; Document Title Bar 


    (3) 
	#define vscroll0x010A/* Vertical Scroll Bar*/ 
	#define hscroll0x010E/* Horiz. Scroll Bar */ 
	#define scrollthm0x0111/* Scroll Thumb */ 
	#define upscroll0x0112/* Up Scroll Arrow */ 
	#define dnscroll0x0113/* Down Scroll Arrow*/ 


    (4) 
	#include &lt;sample. h&gt; 


In the example: 

	(1) The first eight entries give hexadecimal equivalents for 
	the context numbers. 

	(2) The next five entries show decimal context numbers. 

	(3) The next five entries show how you might include 
	items defined in a C #include file. 

	(4) This entry shows a C #include directive for some 
	generic topics. 

If context numbers use the #define directive, and the file containing 
the #define statements is included in both the application code and 
the Help file, then updates made to the context numbers by the 
application programmers are automatically reflected in the next Help 
build. 


You can define the context strings listed in the [Map] section either 
in a Help topic or in the [Alias] section. The compiler generates a 
warning message if a context string appearing in the [Map] section 
is not defined in any of the topic files or in the [Alias] section. 


Note 
	If you use an alias name, the [Alias] section must 
	precede the [Map] section in the Help project file. 


<h2>Including bitmaps by reference: the Bitmaps section</h2>

If your Help system uses bitmaps by reference, the filenames of each 
of the bitmaps must be listed in the [Bitmaps] section of the project 
file. The following example illustrates the format of the [Bitmaps] 
section. 


	[BITMAPS] 
	DUMP01.BMP 
	DUMP02.BMP 
	DUMP03.BMP 
	c:\PROJECT\HELP\BITMAPS\DUMP04.BMP 


Note 
	The [Bitmaps] section uses the same rules as the 
	[Files] section for locating bitmap files. 


<h2>Compiling Help Files</h2>

After you create a Help project file, you are ready to build a Help file 
using the Help Compiler. The compiler generates the binary Help 
resource file from the topic files listed in the Help project file. When 
the build process is complete, your application can access the Help 
resource file that results. 


Before initiating a build operation to create the Help file, consider the 
locations of the following files: 

<ul>
	<li> The Help Compiler, hc. exe. The compiler must be in a 
	directory from which it can be executed. This could be 
	the current working directory on the path set with the 
	PATH environment variable or a directory specified by a 
	full pathname, as follows: 

		\BIN\HC HELPEX. HPJ 

	<li> The Help project file, filename. hpj. The project file can 
	be located either in the current directory or specified by a 
	path, as follows: 

		\BIN\HC D:\MYPROJ\HELPEX. HPJ 

	<li> The topic files named in the Help project file, saved as 
	.rtf. The topic files may be located in the current 
	working directory, a subdirectory of the current working 
	directory specified in the [Files] section, or the 
	location specified in the Root option. 

	<li> Files included with the #include directive in the Help 
	project file. Since the #include directive can take 
	pathnames, then any number of places work for these 
	files. 

	<li> All bitmap files listed by reference in the topic files. 
</ul>


You must also place any files named in an #include directive in 
the path of the project root directory or specify their path using the 
ROOT option. The compiler searches only the directories specified in 
the Help project file. For information about the ROOT option, see the 
section "Specifying the root directory: the Root option" earlier in this 
chapter. 


Note 
	If you use a RAM drive for temporary files (set with 
	the DOS environment variable TMP), it must be 
	large enough to hold the compiled Help resource 
	file. If your Help file is larger than the capacity of 
	the available RAM drive, the compiler generates an 
	error message and the compilation is aborted. 


<h2>Using the Help compiler</h2>

To run the Help Compiler, use the HC command. There are no 
options for HC. All options are specified in the Help project file. 

The HC command uses the following syntax: 

	HC filename.HPJ 

As the compiler program runs, it displays sequential periods on the 
screen, indicating its progress in the process. Error messages are 
displayed when each error condition is encountered. When the Help 
Compiler is finished compiling, it writes a Help resource file with an 
 .hlp extension in the current directory and returns to the DOS 
prompt. The Help resource file that results from the build has the 
same name as does the Help project file. 

Compiler errors and status messages can be redirected to a file using 
standard DOS redirection syntax. This is useful for a lengthy build 
where you may not be monitoring the entire process. The redirected 
file is saved as a text file that can be viewed with any ASCII editor. 


<h2>Programming the Application to Access Help</h2>

The application-development team must program the application so 
that the user can access the Windows Help application and your 
Help file. The Help application is a stand-alone Windows 
application, and your application can ask Windows to run the Help 
application and specify the topic that Help is to show the user. To 
the user, Help appears to be part of your application, but it acts like 
any other Windows application. 


<h2>Calling WinHelp from an application</h2>

An application makes a Help system available to the user by calling 
the WinHelp function. 

The WinHelp function uses the following syntax: 

	BOOL WinHelp (hWnd, lpHelpFile, wCommand, dwData) 

The hWnd parameter identifies the window requesting Help. The 
Windows Help application uses this identifier to keep track of which 
applications have requested Help. 

The lpHelpFile parameter specifies the name (with optional 
directory path) of the Help file containing the desired topic. 

The wCommand parameter specifies either the type of search that the 
Windows Help application is to use to locate the specified topic or 
that the application no longer requires Help. It may be set to any one 
of the following values: 


	Table 26-7 wCommand parameter values 

	Value Meaning 

	HELP_CONTEXT
		Displays Help for a particular topic 
		identified by a context number. 

	HELP_HELPONHELP
		Displays the Using Help index topic. 

	HELP_INDEX
		Displays the main Help index topic. 

	HELP_KEY
		Displays Help for a topic identified by a 
		keyword. 

	HELP_MULTIKEY
		Displays Help for a topic identified by a 
		keyword in an alternate keyword table. 

	HELP_QUIT
		Informs the Help application that Help is 
		no longer needed. If no other 
		applications ask for Help, Windows 
		closes the Help application. 

	HELP_SETINDEX
		Displays a designated Help index topic. 

The dwData parameter specifies the topic for which the application 
is requesting Help. The format of dwData depends upon the value of 
wCommand passed when your application calls WinHelp. The 
following list describes the format of dwData for each value of 
wCommand. 


	Table 26-8 wCommand values and corresponding dwData formats 

	wCommand value
		dwData format 

	HELP_CONTEXT
		An unsigned long integer containing the 
		context number for the topic. Instead of 
		using HELP_INDEX, HELP_CONTEXT can 
		use the value -1. 

	HELP_HELPONHELP
		Ignored. 

	HELP_INDEX
		Ignored. 

	HELP_KEY
		A long pointer to a string that contains a 
		keyword for the desired topic. 

	HELP_MULTIKEY
		A long pointer to the MULTIKEYHELP 
		structure, as defined in WINDOWS. H. This 
		structure specifies the table footnote 
		character and the keyword. 

	HELP_QUIT
		Ignored. 

	HELP_SETINDEX
		An unsigned long integer containing the 
		context number for the topic. 

Because it can specify either a context number or a keyword, 
WinHelp supports both context-sensitive and topical searches of the 
Help file. 


Note 
	To ensure that the correct index remains set, the 
	application should call WinHelp with wCommand 
	set to HELP_SETINDEX (with dwData specifying 
	the corresponding context identifier) following each 
	call to WinHelp with a command set to 
	HELP_CONTEXT. HELP_INDEX should never be 
	used with HELP_SETINDEX. 


<h2>Getting context-sensitive</h2>

Help Context-sensitive Help should be available when a user wants to learn 
about the purpose of a particular window or control. For example, the 
user might pull down the File menu, select the Open command (by 
using the direction keys), and then press F1 to get Help for the 
command. 


Implementing certain types of context-sensitive Help requires 
advanced programming techniques. These techniques are described 
in the following sections. 


<h2>Shift+F1 support</h2>

To implement a Shift+ F1 mode, such as in Microsoft Excel or 
Microsoft Word for Windows, Helpex responds to the Shift+ F1 
accelerator key by calling SetCursor to change the shape of the 
cursor to an arrow pointer supplemented by a question mark. 


	case WM_KEYDOWN:
	    if (wParam == VK_F1) 
	    {   /* turn help mode on &amp; set help cursor */ 
		if (GetKeyState( VK_SHIFT))
		{   
		    bHelp = TRUE;
		    SetCursor(hHelpCursor); 
		    return (DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam)); 
		}
		else 
		{
		    WinHelp(hWnd, szHelpFileName, HELP_INDEX, 0L);
		} 
	    }
	    else 
		if (wParam == VK_ESCAPE &amp;&amp; bHelp)
		{   
		    /* turn help mode off */
		    bHelp = FALSE; 
		    SetCursor((HCURSOR) GetClassWord(hWnd, GCW_HCURSOR)); 
		} 
	    break; 

As long as the user is in Help mode (that is, until he clicks the mouse 
or hits Escape), Helpex responds to WM_SETCURSOR messages by 
resetting the cursor to the arrow and question mark combination. 


	case WM_SETCURSOR:
	    /* In help mode it is necessary to reset */ 
	    /* the cursor in response to every */
	    /* WM_SETCURSOR message. Otherwise, by */ 
	    /* default, Windows will reset the cursor */
	    /* to that of the window class. */ 
	    if (bHelp)
	    {   
		SetCursor(hHelpCursor);
		break; 
	    }
	    return (DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam));

	case WM_INITMENU:
	    if (bHelp) 
	    {
		SetCursor(hHelpCursor); 
	    }
	    return (TRUE); 


When the user is in Shift+F1 Help mode and clicks the mouse button, 
Helpex receives a WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN message if the click is in a 
nonclient area of the application window. By examining the wParam 
value of this message, the program can determine which context ID 
to pass to WinHelp. 


	case WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN:
	    /* If in help mode (Shift+ F1) then display */ 
	    /* context-sensitive help for nonclient area.*/
	    if (bHelp)
	    {   
		dwHelpContextId =
		(wParam == HTCAPTION)?(DWORD) HELPID_TITLE_BAR: 
		(wParam == HTSIZE)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZE_BOX:
		(wParam == HTREDUCE)?(DWORD) HELPID_MINIMIZE_ICON: 
		(wParam == HTZOOM)?(DWORD) HELPID_MAXIMIZE_ICON:
		(wParam == HTSYSMENU)?(DWORD) HELPID_SYSTEM_MENU: 
		(wParam == HTBOTTOM)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZING_BORDER:
		(wParam == HTBOTTOMLEFT)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZING_BORDER: 
		(wParam == HTTOP)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZING_BORDER:
		(wParam == HTLEFT)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZING_BORDER: 
		(wParam == HTRIGHT)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZING_BORDER:
		(wParam == HTTOPLEFT)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZING_BORDER: 
		(wParam == HTTOPRIGHT)?(DWORD) HELPID_SIZING_BORDER:
		    (DWORD) 0L; 


		if (!((BOOL) dwHelpContextId)) 
		    return (DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam)); 
		bHelp = FALSE;
		WinHelp(hWnd, szHelpFileName, HELP_CONTEXT, dwHelpContextId);
		break; 
	    } 

	    return (DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam)); 


<h2>F1 support</h2>

Context-sensitive F1 support for menus is relatively easy to implement 
in your application. If a menu is open and the user presses F1 while 
one of the menu items is highlighted, Windows, after determining that 
F1 is not a valid keystroke for choosing a menu, item sends, a 
WM_ENTERIDLE message to the application to indicate that the 
system is going back into an idle state. You can take advantage of this 
idle state by looking at the keyboard state at the time of the 
WM_ENTERIDLE message. 


If the F1 key is down, then you can simulate the users pressing the 
Enter key by posting a WM_KEYDOWN message using VK_RETURN. 
You don't really want your application to execute the Menu 
command. Set a flag (bHelp= TRUE) so that when you get the 
WM_COMMAND message for the menu item, you don't execute the 
command. Instead, the topic for the menu item is displayed by 
Windows Help. 


The following code samples illustrate F1 sensing for menu items. 


	case WM_ENTERIDLE:
	    if ((wParam == MSGF_MENU) &amp;&amp; (GetKeyState(VK_F1) &amp; 0x8000))
	    {   
		bHelp = TRUE;
		PostMessage(hWnd, WM_KEYDOWN, VK_RETURN, 0L); 
	    }
	    break; 

	case WM_COMMAND:
	    if (bHelp) 
	    {
		dwHelpContextId = 
		(wParam == IDM_NEW)?(DWORD) HELPID_FILE_NEW:
		(wParam == IDM_OPEN)?(DWORD) HELPID_FILE_OPEN: 
		(wParam == IDM_SAVE)?(DWORD) HELPID_FILE_SAVE: 
		(wParam == IDM_SAVEAS)?(DWORD) HELPID_FILE_SAVE_AS:
		(wParam == IDM_PRINT)?(DWORD) HELPID_FILE_PRINT: 
		(wParam == IDM_EXIT)?(DWORD) HELPID_FILE_EXIT:
		(wParam == IDM_UNDO)?(DWORD) HELPID_EDIT_UNDO: 
		(wParam == IDM_CUT)?(DWORD) HELPID_EDIT_CUT:
		(wParam == IDM_CLEAR)?(DWORD) HELPID_EDIT_CLEAR: 
		(wParam == IDM_COPY)?(DWORD) HELPID_EDIT_COPY:
		(wParam == IDM_PASTE)?(DWORD) HELPID_EDIT_PASTE:
		    (DWORD) 0L; 
		if (!dwHelpContextId)
		{   
		    Messagebox(hWnd," Help not available", "Help Example", MB_OK); 
		    return (DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam));
		} 
		bHelp = FALSE; 
		WinHelp(hWnd, szHelpFileName, HELP_CONTEXT, dwHelpContextId); 
		break;
	    } 


Detecting F1 in dialog boxes is somewhat more difficult than in 
menus. You must install a message filter, using the WH_MSGFILTER 
option of the SetWindowsHook function. Your message filter function 
responds to WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP messages for VK_F1 when 
they are sent to a dialog box, as indicated by the MSGF_DIALOGBOX 
code. By examining the message structure passed to the filter, you can 
determine the context of the F1 help, what the dialog box is, and the 
specific option or item. You should not call WinHelp while 
processing the filtered message, but rather post an application-defined 
message to your application to call WinHelp at the first 
available opportunity. 


<h2>Getting Help on an item listed on the Help menu</h2>

Sometimes users may want information about a general concept in 
the application rather than about a particular control or window. In 
these cases, the application should provide Help for a particular topic 
that is identified by a keyword rather than by a context identifier. 


For example, if the Help file for your application contains a topic that 
describes how the keyboard is used, you could place a Keyboard item 
in your Help menu. Then when the user selects that item, your 
application would call WinHelp and request that topic: 

	case IDM_HELP_KEYBOARD:
	     WinHelp(hWnd, lpHelpFile, HELP_KEY, (LPSTR)"Keyboard");
	     break; 


<h2>Accessing additional keyword tables</h2>

Your application may have commands or terms that correspond to 
terms in a similar but different application. Given a keyword, the 
application can call WinHelp and look up topics defined in an 
alternative keyword table. This Multikey functionality is accessed 
through the WinHelp hook with the wCommand parameter set to 
HELP_MULTIKEY. 


Specify the footnote character for the alternative keyword table 
and the keyword or phrase, via a MULTIKEYHELP structure, which is 
passed as the dwData parameter in the call to WinHelp. This 
structure is defined in windows.h as: 


	typedef struct tag MULTIKEYHELP 
	{   
	    WORD mdSize; 
	    BYTE mkKeyList; 
	    BYTE szKeyPhrase[1]; 
	} MULTIKEYHELP; 


The following table lists the format of the fields of the 
MULTIKEYHELP structure: 

	Table 26-9 MULTIKEYHELP field formats 

	Parameter
		Format 

	mkSize
		The size of the structure, including the keyword 
		(or phrase) and the associated key-table letter 

	mkKeyList
		A single character that defines the footnote 
		character for the alternate keyword table to be 
		searched 

	szKeyPhrase
		A null-terminated keyword or phrase to be looked 
		up in the alternate keyword table 

The following example illustrates a keyword search for the word 
frame in the alternate keyword table designated with the footnote 
character L: 


	MULTIKEYHELP mk; 
	char szKeyword[]= frame; 
	mk.mkSize = sizeof(MULTIKEYHELP) + (WORD) lstrlen(szKeyword); 
	mk.mkKeylist= L; 
	mk.szKeyphrase= szKeyword; 
	WinHelp(hWnd, lpHelpfile, HELP_MULTIKEY, (LPSTR)&amp; mk); 


<h2>Canceling Help</h2>

The Windows Help application is a shared resource that is available 
to all Windows applications. In addition, since it is a stand-alone 
application, the user can execute it like any other application. As a 
result, your application has limited control over the Help application. 
While your application cannot directly close the Help application 
window, your application can inform the Help application that Help 
is no longer needed. Before closing its main window, your 
application should call WinHelp with the wCommand parameter set to 
HELP_QUIT, as shown in the following example, to inform the Help 
application that your application will not need it again. 


	case WM_DESTROY: 
	    WinHelp (hWnd, lpHelpFile, HELP_QUIT, NULL); 


An application that calls WinHelp at some point during its execution 
must call WinHelp with the wCommand parameter set to HELP_QUIT 
before the application exits from WinMain (typically during the 
WM_DESTROY message processing). 


If an application opens more than one Help file, then it must call 
WinHelp to quit help for each file. 


If an application or DLL has opened a Help file but no longer wants 
the associated instance of the Help engine (winhelp. exe) to remain 
active, then the application or DLL should call WinHelp with the 
wCommand parameter set to HELP_QUIT to destroy the instance of 
the Help engine. 


Under no circumstances should an application or DLL terminate 
without calling WinHelp for any of the opened Help files. A Help file 
is opened if any other WinHelp call has been previously made using 
the Help filename. 


The Windows Help application does not exit until all windows that 
call WinHelp have called it with wCommand set to HELP_QUIT. If an 
application fails to do so, then the Help application continues running 
all applications that request Help terminate. 


<h2>Help Compiler Error Messages</h2>

This chapter contains a list of Help Compiler error messages. Each 
message is shown as it appears when the compiler encounters the 
specific error. A short explanation accompanies each message to aid 
you in solving the problem in your Help system. Preceding the error 
message listing is a short description of the error reporting behavior 
of the Help Compiler. Understanding how the compiler reports and 
reacts to errors helps you debug your Help files. 


<h2>The Help compiler and errors</h2>

The Help Compiler displays messages when it encounters errors in 
building the Help resource file. Errors during processing of the 
project file are numbered beginning with the letter P and appear as 
in the following examples: 


	Error P1025: line... 7 of filename.HPJ : Section heading sectionname unrecognized. 
	Warning P1039: line... 38 of filename.HPJ : [BUILDTAGS] section missing. 

Errors that occur during processing of the .rtf topic file(s) are 
numbered beginning with the letter R and appear as in the following 
examples: 

	Error R2025: File environment error. 
	Warning R2501: Using old key-phrase table. 

Whenever possible, the compiler displays the topic number and/ or 
filename that contains the error. Although topics are not numbered, 
the topic number given with an error message refers to that topic's 
sequential position in your rtf file (first, second, etc.). These 
numbers may be identical to the page number shown by your word 
processor, depending on the number of lines you assign to the 
hypothetical printed page. Remember that topics are separated by 
hard page breaks, even though there is no such thing as a page in 
the Help system. 


Messages beginning with the word Error are fatal errors. Errors are 
always reported, and no usable Help resource file results from the 
build. Messages beginning with the word Warning are less serious 
in nature. A build with warnings produces a valid Help resource file 
that loads under Windows, but the file may contain operational 
errors. You can specify the amount of warning information to be 
reported by the compiler. For more information on choosing 
warning levels to be displayed, see the section "Specifying error 
reporting: the Warning option" earlier in this chapter. 


The compiler's reaction to an error is described for each error in the 
listing that follows. During processing of the project file, the 
compiler ignores lines that contain errors and attempts to continue 
with the build. This means that errors encountered early in a build 
may result in many more errors being reported as the build 
continues. Similarly, errors during processing of the .rtf topic files 
are reported and if not serious, the compiler continues with the 
build. A single error condition in the topic file may result in more 
than one error message being reported by the compiler. For 
instance, a misidentified topic causes an error to be reported every 
time jump terms refer to the correct topic identifier. Such a mistake is 
easily rectified by correcting the footnote containing the wrong 
context string.
