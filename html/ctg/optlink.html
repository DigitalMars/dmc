<h1>OPTLINK</h1>


OPTLINK, the Digital Mars linker, links object files and libraries to
produce an executable program or DLL for DOS, Windows 3.x, or Win32.
For simple programs, the link step can be run automatically
by the compiler. For more complex applications that need close control
over how the program is linked, run OPTLINK as a separate step.
<p>

To control running the linker from the IDDE,
set options in the <b>Linker</b> subpage on the 
<b>Build</b> page of the IDDE's <b>Project Settings</b> dialog box.

	<li> <a href="#features">Features</a>
	<li> <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>
	<li> <a href="#environment">Environment Variables</a>
	<li> <a href="#operational">Operational Modes</a>
</ul>

<a name="overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>

OPTLINK is a super-fast, high-capacity program linker. It is designed 
for use by professional programmers to efficiently create both 
standard .exe and .com executable files for use with MS-DOS and 
segmented .exe files (segmented executable) and dynamic link 
libraries (.dll) for use with Windows and Win32 in significantly 
less time than is required by other linkers.
<p>

OPTLINK derives its spectacular speed from being written entirely in hand-
tuned assembly language, making maximal use of multithreading and processor
scheduling. It does full links faster than more pedestrian linkers do
incremental links.
<p>

OPTLINK combines object (.obj) and library (.lib) files into a
single file that is 
executable by the operating system. OPTLINK can optionally
create memory maps and symbol tables that are useful for debugging.
<p>


OPTLINK works with modules in Intel OMF format (.obj file), 
including those generated by standard assemblers, compilers and 
standard object module libraries. The output files produced have all 
address assignments resolved and are in one of three standard 
formats:

<ul>
	<li> 16 bit DOS .exe relocatable executable MZ format (MSDOS)
	<li> 16 bit .com/.sys/.bin memory image format (MSDOS)
	<li> 16 bit segmented .exe NE format (Windows 3.x)
	<li> 32 bit .exe PE format (PE) (DOSX, Win32) 
</ul>


All available memory is used by OPTLINK when linking 
executable programs. For 16-bit programs, the number of program 
description objects that can be accommodated is limited to 64KB for 
each kind of object (PUBLIC, LIBRARY, SEGMENT, and so on). If 
memory space is inadequate, the program descriptions are 
automatically paged out to disk files which are then deleted once the 
link process completes. 
<p>

These features combine to create an environment in which you can 
create large programs, despite apparent memory constraints. 

<a name="features"><h2>Features</h2></a>

Although compatibility with existing linkers was a prime objective in 
the design of OPTLINK, the product sets itself apart from other 
linkers with a number of exclusive features. OPTLINK features 
include: 

<ul>

	<li><b>Speed </b><br>
	Executes faster than any other method for creating 
	executable files. Removal of duplicate records (CVPACK) 
	is built in. 


	<li><b>Capacity </b><br>
	Successfully builds huge applications, including debug 
	information. 


	<li><b>Smart linking</b><br> 
	Unlike others, recursively eliminates unreferenced code. 
	Also eliminates unreferenced uninitialized global 
	variables, see /PACKFUNCTIONS. 


	<li><b>Efficient program generation options </b><br>
	Builds smaller, more efficient, faster loading and even 
	faster running 16-bit programs by packing code and data, 
	plus converting intra-segment far calls to near calls, see 
	/PACKCODE, /PACKDATA, /EXEPACK, 
	/FARCALLTRANSLATION. 


	<li><b>Cross referencing </b><br>
	Optionally included within map output. Every global 
	symbol and the module name( s) of where defined and 
	referenced is listed, see /XREF. 


	<li><b>Environment use </b><br>
	Dedicated environment variable usage simplifies searches. 


	<li><b>Virtual memory system</b><br> 
	When DOS hosted, automatically uses EMS memory, XMS 
	memory, or disk storage, whichever is available. 

</ul>


<h3>Option switch precedence</h3>

Switches are read and processed in lexical order.
Any subsequent switch overrides any previous switch setting. 

<ol>
	<li> The <b>optlinks.cfg</b> configuration file.<br> 
	<li> The <b>LINK</b> environment variable. <br>
	<li> The <b>OPTLINKS</b> environment variable. <br>
	<li> Command line and indirect response file in the order 
	supplied. Recognizes the most recent switch syntax 
	selected.
</ol>

<a name="configuration"><h3>Configuration</h3></a>

To specify default operating parameters not available through the 
IDDE, modify the file named optlinks.cfg. You can supply 
option switches that you may regularly use or desire as default. 
When called, optlinks.cfg, an ASCII file, is read by OPTLINK 
from its home directory, unless optlinks.cfg already exists in the 
current directory. OPTLINK recognizes the "#" as a comment 
character and thus ignores the remainder of the line. 


<a name="environment"><h2>Environment Variables</h2></a>

The environment variable names recognized are LIB, TMP, LINK, 
OPTLINKS and OBJ. OPTLINK also searches the PATH environment 
variable to locate certain executable files. The environment variables 
are typically defined in autoexec.bat or another batch file. 

<dl><dl>

	<dt><b>LIB</b>
	<dd>Supplies paths to search for libraries, object files,
	and resource files. 
	See also /SCANLIB. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>TMP</b>
	<dd>Supplies a path used by OPTLINK for its virtual memory file. 
	Otherwise, the current directory is used. OPTLINK's performance 
	can be severely slowed when its virtual memory file must be stored 
	across a network. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>LINK</b>
	<dd>Supplies linker switch settings. Recognized for Microsoft LINK 
	compatibility. See also /SCANLINK. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>OPTLINKS</b>
	<dd>Supplies linker switch settings. OPTLINKS is scanned after the LINK 
	variable and can override any previous settings specified. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>OBJ</b>
	<dd>Supplies paths to be searched by OPTLINK for .obj files not found 
	in the current working directory. Paths specified by OBJ are always 
	searched before any paths specified by the LIB environment 
	variable. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>PATH</b>
	<dd>Supplies paths to be searched by OPTLINK for any stub .exe file 
	specified in the .def file. 

</dl></dl>

For example, to select the linker option /IGNORECASE as the 
default, the following command could be used: 
<pre>
	set OPTLINKS=/IG 
</pre>

The environment variables can be overridden by command line 
input. Every switch can be changed, since it has an opposite. 


<h3>Versions of OPTLINK</h3>

<ul>
	<li> linknd.dll DLL version for use in IDDE.
	<li> link.exe Win32 command line version.
	<li> lnkr.exe DOS real mode version (obsolete).
</ul>

<h2>Optimizing Linker Performance</h2>

For fast execution of the linker, follow these guidelines. 

<ul>

	<li> Disable relocation checks by using the 
	/NORELOCATIONCHECK option. <br><br>

	<li> If the /MAP option is being used to create a .map file, 
	disable sorting of the map by using the /MAP:<i>address</i> 
	option. <br><br>

	<li> If the /MAP option is being used to create a .map file, 
	disable placement of line number information in the map 
	by using the /NOLINENUMBERS option (the default). <br><br>

	<li> If the executable file is a Windows program, use the /RC 
	option to add resources to the executable file. <br><br>

	<li> If running OPTLINK from a Windows DOS box, 
	use the DPMI version (link.exe) and set the DOS box 
	.pif file parameters in dosprmpt.pif as follows: <br><br>
	XMS required: 0XMS memory not locked (-1 desired) <br>
	EMS required: 0EMS memory not locked (-1 desired) <br><br>

	<li> Configure a small RAM disk so more EMS, XMS, or DPMI 
	memory is available for OPTLINK. <br><br>

	<li> Avoid linking to a network server. <br><br>
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="operational"><h2>Operational Modes</h2></a>

OPTLINK can get commands from the command line, interactively,
or from an indirect file.
All input on the command line should be in a series of parameters. 
For the interactive mode at a console, use link.exe. Using indirect 
file operation, you can enter prompt-like responses into a file. The 
specific file name is passed to OPTLINK on the command line and 
is read by OPTLINK for its linker input. 
<p>
In all modes of operation, OPTLINK commands, switches and parameters
are the same.


<h3>Command Line and Interactive Operation</h3>

Command line operation of OPTLINK uses the following syntax: 
<pre>
	LINK obj[,out[,map[,lib[,def[,res]]]]] 
</pre>
For interactive operation input LINK followed by any option 
switches (described later) and press Enter. OPTLINK then 
prompts for responses. Option switches may be entered after 
any response. 
<p>

OPTLINK parameters include the following: 

<dl><dl>
	<dt><b>obj</b>
	<dd>One or more input (.obj) file names.
	If multiple names are 
	supplied, they may be joined by "+" characters or blank spaces, but 
	the comma separates the four parts of the command line. If more 
	names are required than are able to fit onto the command line, a "+" 
	immediately before the end of the line makes the list continue to the 
	next line. 
	<p>

	Wild-card characters "?" and "*" to specify multiple files are
	allowed. If 
	specific names are preceded or followed by wild-card references, 
	those modules specifically named will not be included twice. At the 
	end of the input list, use specific data or a "+" character to 
	invoke the default choices. If neither is supplied, operation switches 
	to the interactive mode, and OPTLINK prompts for the remaining 
	inputs. The "#" character tells OPTLINK to ignore the rest of the 
	comment characters following on that line. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>out</b>
	<dd>Specifies the name for the output executable or dynamic link library. 
	If no extension is supplied, an .exe file is generated; if the 
	extension is .com, a .com file is created automatically, and if 
	extension is .sys, a binary device driver format file is created. To 
	skip this entry and cause OPTLINK to default to the executable type 
	provided in a definition file or option switch, supply a comma or 
	press the Enter key in the interactive mode. If no directive or option 
	switch is supplied, the default file name (that of the first .obj file) 
	with .exe extension will be created. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>map</b>
	<dd>The file name for map output.
	Using an Enter key while in the 
	interactive mode suppresses all map output, unless previously 
	configured with a /MAP suggested file name. See the related switch 
	descriptions (/MAP, /XREF, /LINENUMBERS, or /DETAILEDMAP) 
	later in this manual. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>lib</b>
	<dd>Searches in order one or more library names to resolve any symbols 
	not defined in the input .obj files.
	Wild card references can be used as with the obj entry.
	The libraries are searched 
	in the order specified here. Use the "+" character
	to separate multiple libraries.
	Use the "+" continuation 
	character that comes before the end-of-line or before the comment 
	(#) string to extend past the end of the line. 
	<p>

	The lib entry may be either a single file name or a pathname (with 
	trailing "\") to a directory containing the libraries. 
	<p>
	OPTLINK searches library files in the order that they are presented to 
	it: that is, those named on the command line, and then those 
	referenced by embedded commands in object modules. 
	To locate each library file for which no path is specified, OPTLINK 
	first searches the current directory followed by any paths specified in 
	the LIB variable, and finally any paths named in the command line. 
	<p>

	<dt><b>def</b>
	<dd>The <a href="ctgDefFiles.html">module definition file</a> name.
	Optionally supplied, this file contains 
	program linking information.
	<p>

	<dt><b>res</b>
	<dd>One or more resource (.RES) file names.
	When supplied, OPTLINK 
	performs the bind step of the Resource Compiler while linking. This 
	eliminates the need to use a Resource Compiler to combine 
	resources to the output file. 

</dl></dl>

Also like the .OBJ entry, wild-card references may be used. The 
libraries will be searched in the order specified. The same separators 
used for the obj portion apply, and the res entry may also be 
extended past the end of a line by means of the continuance 
character (+) immediately before the end of line or comment (#) 
string. 


<h3>Examples of command line operation</h3>

The simplest method of using OPTLINK is to provide only the name 
of the .obj file to be used and accept the default suggestions for all 
other parameters: 
<pre>
	C&gt; LINK DUMP;
	OPTLINK Copyright (C) Digital Mars 1989-94 
	All rights reserved.
</pre>
OPTLINK's sign-on copyright message is displayed on the console as 
shown above. 
<p>

If the .obj file does not exist in the current directory or in any of 
the paths supplied by the environment variables, OPTLINK sends an 
error message: 
<pre>
	C&gt; LINK DUMPER;
	OPTLINK Copyright (C) Digital Mars 1989-94 
	All rights reserved.
	DUMPER.OBJ 
	Error 2: File Not Found DUMPER.OBJ 
</pre>
If there is not a semicolon on a short command line, OPTLINK 
reverts to the interactive mode after all command line input is used, 
as the following examples indicate: 
<pre>
	C&gt; LINK DUMP,,MYMAP;
	OPTLINK Copyright (C) Digital Mars 1989-94 
	All rights reserved. 

	C&gt; LINK DUMP,,MYMAP
	OPTLINK Copyright (C) Digital Mars 1989-94 
	All rights reserved.
	Libraries and Paths: (.lib): 
	Definition File: (.def):
	Resource Files: (.res) 
</pre>

<h3>Examples of interactive operation</h3>

Use the Enter key at the Map File: prompt. 
<pre>
	C&gt; LINK
	OPTLINK Copyright (C) Digital Mars 1989-94 
	All rights reserved.
	OBJ Files: (.obj): curset 
	Output File: (curset.exe):
	Map File: (.map): 
	Libraries and Paths: (.lib):
	Definition File: (.def): 
	Resource Files: (.res) 
</pre>

Using the "+" and the "#" comment characters causes multiple 
responses at the OBJ Files: prompt: 

<pre>
	C&gt; LINK
	OPTLINK Copyright (C) Digital Mars 1989-94 
	All rights reserved.
	OBJ Files: (.obj): file1+	# this is the first object file
	OBJ Files: (.obj): file2+ 
	OBJ Files: (.obj): file3	# this is the last
	Output File: (file1.exe): myfile 
	Map File: (.map):
	Libraries and Paths: (.lib): mylib 
	Definition File: (.def):
	Resource Files: (.res) 
</pre>


Or use multiple file names on the same line: 
<pre>
	C&gt; LINK
	OPTLINK Copyright (C) Digital Mars 1989-94 
	All rights reserved. OBJ Files: (.obj): file1 file2 file3 
	Output File: (file1.exe): myfile
	Map File: (.map): 
	Libraries and Paths: (.lib): mylib
	Definition File: (.def): 
	Resource Files: (.res) 
</pre>


<h3>Indirect File Operation</h3>

For more file names or option switches than 
the command line can hold, use indirect file operation to 
effectively eliminate any limit on the amount of information
supplied to OPTLINK. For most complicated applications, this is the 
best choice. 
<p>

OPTLINK uses the following syntax for indirect file operation: 
<pre>
	LINK @<i>indirfile</i>
</pre>

where <i>indirfile</i> is the name of an indirect response file.
During interactive operation at 
each prompt, the indirect response file has a number of text lines. 

<h3>Example of indirect file operation</h3>

If the file lnklst contains the following lines: 

<pre>
	DUMP
	NEWEXE 
	MYMAP; 
</pre>

then the following command lines are equivalent except that line 
length in an indirect file is unlimited, while DOS limits the command 
line to a maximum of 125 characters. 

<pre>
	LINK @LNKLST 
	LINK DUMP,NEWEXE,MYMAP; 
</pre>

It is legal to use combinations of indirect file operation and either 
command line or interactive operation. OPTLINK accepts more than 
one indirect file specification. There are only two constraints: the 
indirect files that are combined must result in a valid sequence of 
responses and cannot be nested more than 10 deep. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
	It is possible for a valid file name to actually begin 
	with the "@" character. To keep such a file from 
	being erroneously recognized by OPTLINK as an 
	indirect response file, enclose the entire name of 
	the file in quotation marks. 


<h3>Command formats</h3>

All three methods of providing command input use exactly the same 
format for input information.

 
<h3>File name usage</h3>

OPTLINK uses the same file-naming conventions as those supplied 
by the host operating system. 
If a file extension is supplied, it must be separated from the name by 
a period. If none is supplied, OPTLINK assumes or creates a default 
value as described below. 
<p>

The file name may be preceded by a pathname, which may be either 
absolute or relative and may include a drive specifier. If no path is 
specified, OPTLINK searches only the current working directory for 
the file or creates it in the current working directory. If a drive is 
specified, but no path, only the current directory for the specified 
drive is used. 


<h3>Default file extensions</h3>

If the file extension is omitted from a file name, OPTLINK assumes 
or creates a default extension for the file that is determined by the 
command with which the file name is associated. For instance, the 
default extensions for the file names supplied with the OBJ Files: 
prompt is .obj and for the Map File: prompt is .map. The 
defaults follow and are described later for each command that 
assumes or creates one. To refer to a file that has no 
extension and without using the default, add the 
"." separator after the file name to tell OPTLINK not to supply an 
extension. 


<dl><dl>
	<dt><b>.def</b>
	<dd><a href="ctgDefFiles.html">Module Definition File</a>
	<dt><b>.exe</b>
	<dd>Executable files created by OPTLINK 
	<dt><b>.lib</b>
	<dd>Library files 
	<dt><b>.map</b>
	<dd>Listing of addresses generated by OPTLINK 
	<dt><b>.obj</b>
	<dd>Object files (in OMF format) 
	<dt><b>.cfg</b>
	<dd>Configuration file for default OPTLINK settings 
	<dt><b>.res</b>
	<dd>Resource files 
	<dt>none
	<dd>Indirect command file used by OPTLINK 
</dl></dl>

<h3>Special file names</h3>

Since OPTLINK uses standard I/O for keyboard input and 
screen output, device names can be used in place of file names and 
you may redirect input and output. The device names are: 


<dl><dl>
	<dt>AUX
	<dd>refers to an auxiliary device (usually the same as 
	COM1) 

	<dt>CON
	<dd>refers to the console (keyboard input or display 
	output) 

	<dt>PRN
	<dd>refers to the printer (usually the same as LPT1) 
	NUL a null (nonexistent) file; if given as an input name, 
	returns end-of-file; if given as an output name, no 
	output is generated 
</dl></dl>


To redirect OPTLINK input and output from and to files, use the 
standard redirection keys. For example, the following command 
redirects OPTLINK output (including all prompts) to file link.log 
instead of to the screen: 

<pre>
LINK UTILITY; &gt;LINK.LOG 
</pre>
