<h1>OPTLINK Error Messages</h1>

This lists warnings, plus non-fatal and fatal error messages 
generated by OPTLINK. When appropriate, any probable cause 
and/or remedy is briefly discussed. The DOS return code and 
segmented .exe error flag is set upon OPTLINK encountering either 
a Non-Fatal or Fatal error. Warnings have no effect on the code or 
flag. See also /ONERROR and /DELEXECUTABLE. 
<p>

Each warning and error message, with added information such as 
the symbol name or file name involved, is displayed to stdout
and added to the .map file (if selected) when its triggering 
condition is detected. To create a log of errors, command line redirection 
may be used:

	<pre>
	link foo; &gt;log
	</pre>

The following rules apply when displayed: If the file name is known, 
it is printed. If the module name is known, it is printed (useful 
especially if the file name is .lib). If the error occurs at a known 
offset in the file, the offset (in hexadecimal) is printed. If a specific 
object record is being worked on, its record type (a number in hex 
corresponding to the standard Intel OMF or some extension) is 
printed. And in every case, an error number (not significant since 
these numbers may vary between OPTLINK versions and/or other 
linkers) is printed followed by the text. 


<ul>
	<li> <a href="#warning">Warning Messages</a>
	<li> <a href="#nonfatal">Non-Fatal Error Messages</a>
	<li> <a href="#fatal">Fatal Error Messages</a>
</ul>


<hr>
<h2><a name="warning">Warning Messages</a></h2>

Warnings alert the operator to an 
inconsistency rather than diagnosing a known error. These messages 
indicate code that may not execute as expected but does link. 
OPTLINK completes its operation and the output file may be usable. 


<h4>ALIAS Previously Defined</h4> 

An attempt to alias an already-defined symbol was detected. The 
ALIAS directive is ignored. 


<h4>Bad Checksum</h4>

A checksum error was detected in an input file. Perhaps the file has 
been corrupted. 


<h4>Below 100H Cannot Be Initialized</h4>

While creating a .com file, an attempt to initialize data areas at an 
address lower than 0100h was detected. 


<h4>Cannot Allocate EMS Blocks</h4> 

An EMS allocation call failed. The EMS driver has provided 
inconsistent information. OPTLINK will use alternative memory 
space instead. 


<h4>Cannot Generate Segmented .COM or .SYS File</h4> 

A .com or .sys extension was specified as the output file name 
when a .def file had also been supplied. 


<h4>COMMON Combine type overrides others</h4> 

Multiple combine types were specified for a given named segment. 
In such a conflict, the COMMON combine type overrides all others, 
and the multiple segments will be combined into a single segment. 


<h4>Duplicate RESOURCE, Ignored</h4> 

A second resource was found within the .res file with the same 
name and type as one already processed. The second resource is 
ignored. 


<h4>File Not Found</h4> 

The specified .lib file could not be found in order to complete 
command operations. If referring to an .obj file or an indirect 
command file, this indicates a fatal error, described later in the fatal 
error section. 


<h4>Heap without DGROUP</h4> 

Heapsize was defined with no DGROUP or zero length DGROUP. 
Causes Windows to crash. 


<h4>Grouped Segments Have Conflicting Flags</h4> 

Segments in a single group have different flag settings declared via 
the SEGMENTS directive in the .def file. Since a group is a single 
physical segment in protected mode, all segments that make up the 
group must have the same flags. 
<p>

This warning may be caused by the fact that any non-default flags 
override the default settings. That is, a MOVABLE segment overrides a 
FIXED segment, and the whole group becomes MOVABLE. 


<h4>LINNUMs in Non-CODE Segment</h4> 

A LINNUM statement was encountered within a data segment. 


<h4>Missing LIBRARY in .DEF File for .DLL</h4> 

A .dll extension was specified for the output file, but no LIBRARY 
directive appears in the .def file. The .dll is created with default 
assumptions. 


<h4>No Stack</h4> 

No stack segment was supplied. If a .com or .sys file is being 
generated, it is normal; in other cases, be careful. 


<h4><a name="no_start_address">No Start Address</a></h4> 

The end of the last .obj file was reached and start address was not 
detected. In assembler programming, start addresses are specified by 
putting a label after the END statement. In high level languages, 
perhaps the start up modules were not supplied. 
In C and C++ programs, this typically means that the program has
no main(), wmain(), WinMain(), DllMain(), or LibMain().


<h4>Segment Already in Different Group</h4> 

OPTLINK detected a second attempt to assign a segment to a group. 
Each segment can belong to only one group. 


<h4>Stack Already Declared in Module</h4> 

OPTLINK detected a second attempt to define a stack segment. Each 
program can have only one stack segment. The warning is followed 
by the name of the module that first declared a stack. 


<h4>STACK Combine type overrides others</h4> 

Multiple combine types were specified for a given named segment. 
In such a conflict, the STACK combine type overrides all others, and 
the multiple segments will be combined into a single segment. 


<h4>Start Previously Specified in Module</h4> 

More than one start address was specified for a program. Start 
addresses are specified by putting a label after the END statement. 
Only one module should specify a start address. If OPTLINK finds 
more than one, it uses the first one encountered. 


<h4>Symbol in this LIB defined elsewhere</h4> 

Warning message generated from /WARNDUPS. 


<h4>Too Many Segments, Trying PACKCODE</h4> 

The segmented .exe format can hold only 254 segments. This 
warning appears when more than 254 segments exist and 
/PACKCODE was not specified. OPTLINK automatically invokes 
/PACKCODE in an attempt to reduce the segment count to a number 
below 255. 


<h4>Too Many Segments, Trying PACKDATA</h4> 

The segmented .exe format can hold only 254 segments. This 
warning appears when more than 254 segments exist after OPTLINK 
attempted to /PACKCODE, and /PACKDATA was not specified. 
OPTLINK automatically invokes /PACKDATA in an attempt to reduce 
the segment count to a number below 255. 


<h4>Unknown Option</h4> 

OPTLINK encountered a misspelled, incomplete, or unsupported 
option switch. 


<h4>Unsupported GRPDEF Type</h4> 

An invalid GRPDEF record was encountered. The bad record is 
ignored. 


<hr>
<h2><a name="nonfatal">Non-Fatal Error Messages</a></h2>

These are errors which may make the output file unusable, but did 
not prevent OPTLINK from completing successfully. Processing 
continues if any of these errors are detected, but the output file that 
is generated should not be used. 


<h4>.EXE Header &gt; 64k</h4> 

The resident portion of a .dll or .exe header approaches or 
exceeds 64Kb. Windows loads this header into a single segment; 
therefore, it must be smaller than 64Kb. The sizes of the various 
pieces that make up the header are listed. You probably need to 
import/export by ordinal to reduce name table sizes. 


<h4>Bad COMDEF Sizes</h4> 

An size error was detected in a COMDEF record. 


<h4>Badly Formed Segment Size</h4> 

The BIG bit was set and segment size was not zero. 


<h4>BYTE Out of Range</h4> 

Code such as: 
<pre>
	mov al, ext_abs 
</pre>
where ext_abs is greater than 255, was encountered. 


<h4>Cannot Export</h4> 

Symbol cannot be exported. It may be either undefined or a 
constant. Symbols must have an associated segment to be exported. 


<h4>Cannot Reach TARGET from FRAME</h4> 

A traditional "fixup overflow" was detected by OPTLINK. Usually 
caused by: memory-model conflicts, a segment or group being too 
large, segment order or combining errors (look at the map file 
output to diagnose this), incorrect ASSUME statements, trying to 
access a variable when no segment register points to it, or trying to 
do a NEAR CALL / NEAR JMP to a FAR routine. 


<h4>CEXTDEF With No COMDAT</h4> 

The end of an object file was reached and a CEXTDEF item remains 
unresolved. 


<h4>COMDAT Continuation Mismatch</h4> 

A COMDAT continuation record appears before the COMDAT 
definition to which it refers. If you get this error, please contact 
Digital Mars Technical Support. 


<h4>COMDAT Syntax</h4> 

Due to either corrupt files, translator errors, internal errors in 
OPTLINK, or unknown enhancements to the OMF conventions. If 
you get this error, please contact Digital Mars Technical Support. 


<h4>Constants Must Have FRAME=0</h4> 

A constant having a FRAME value other than zero was detected. 
While not prohibited in Intel's OMF format, this is not valid in the 
Microsoft version. 


<h4>CODE Directive</h4> 

A syntax error was detected in a CODE directive. 


<h4>DATA Directive</h4> 

A syntax error was detected in a DATA directive. 


<h4>Data Outside Segment Bounds</h4> 

OPTLINK found more data in an object module than expected. For 
example, an object file that indicates 5 bytes of data are to follow, 
and then provides 6, will cause this error. Most likely cause is that 
the object file has been corrupted, or that a translator error has 
occurred. 


<h4>Data Overlaps Relocations</h4> 

Displayed while the /RELOCATIONCHECK option was in effect and 
an overlap was detected. Probable causes include initialization of the 
COMMON segment in more than one module, use of the ORG 
statement to back up over existing code, or a translator error. The 
problem must be resolved, or all other addresses referenced in the 
output file may be wrong since relocation information is often stored 
as in-place linked lists. 


<h4>Delimited String Expected</h4> 

OPTLINK failed to find a delimited string required by the directive 
syntax being parsed. 


<h4>DGROUP + Stack + Heap Exceeds 64K - 16</h4>
 
The total sizes of Heap, Stack, and DGROUP exceed 65,520 bytes. 
Try reducing the size of the stack or the heap, or use HEAPSIZE 
MAXVAL. 


<h4>Duplicate OLD</h4> 

A second OLD directive was encountered. 


<h4>Duplicate ORDINAL Number</h4> 

The ordinal number specified for this symbol was already specified 
for use by another symbol. Two exported symbols cannot have the 
same ordinal number. 


<h4>Duplicate RC Commands</h4> 

Both the RC directive in the .def file and the /RC option switch 
were supplied. Eliminate one of the two to correct the error. 


<h4>Duplicate STUB</h4> 

A second STUB directive was encountered. 


<h4>EXETYPE Directive</h4> 

A syntax error was detected in an EXETYPE directive. 


<h4>EXPORTS Directive</h4> 

A syntax error was detected in an EXPORTS directive. 


<h4>_Export Conflicts With EXPORTS</h4> 

OPTLINK detected a symbol with a different name or parameter list 
size in the .def file than was present in the .obj file. They should 
agree. 


<h4>FIXUPP Points Past Data Record</h4> 

OPTLINK detected a situation such as a FIXUPP record instructing 
that the doubleword beginning at byte 5 of a data record be 
changed, when the data record contains only six bytes (since a 
doubleword beginning at byte 5 would extend through byte 8). Most 
likely, the .obj file has been corrupted or a translator error 
occurred. 


<h4>GROUP Cannot Be Both Relocatable and Absolute</h4> 

A segment defined as SEGMENT AT was placed within a GROUP 
with a normal relocatable segment. 


<h4>Group Cannot Contain CODE and DATA Segments</h4> 

Segments in the same group have different type flag settings, via the 
SEGMENTS directive in the .def file or their class names. Since a 
group is a single physical segment in protected mode, the type for 
the whole group must be either code or data. It cannot contain both 
types. 


<h4>Group Size Exceeds 64k</h4> 

The total size of all segments named within a Group exceeds 65,536 
bytes. 


<h4>Groups Overlap</h4> 

An overlap of groups was detected. In protected mode, groups are 
logical segments, and cannot be permitted to overlap. To reorder 
segments in such a way that the overlap is eliminated, use 
/REORDERSEGMENTS. 


<h4>HEAPSIZE Directive</h4> 

A syntax error was detected in a HEAPSIZE directive. 


<h4>Illegal Frame On Start Address</h4> 

Detected a FIXUPP error on the start address. Check the module 
defining the start address. 


<h4>Illegal Start Address</h4> 

An absolute address was used as a start address in relocatable mode. 
Correct the address. 


<h4>IMPORT Illegal As Start Address</h4> 

The start address was specified as a symbol imported from another 
library. This is illegal. The start address must be in the .exe, not in a 
 .dll. 


<h4>IMPORTS Directive</h4> 

A syntax error was detected in a IMPORTS directive. 


<h4>LOCATION Not Within FRAME</h4> 

A CALL or JMP was made and the CS ASSUME is not valid. 


<h4>Library Error</h4> 

A library problem was detected. The most likely cause is a corrupted 
library dictionary. 


<h4>LINSYM Before COMDAT</h4> 

A LINSYM record points to a non-existent COMDAT record. Most 
likely, caused by either an invalid forward reference or a translator 
error. 


<h4>Multiple Descriptions</h4> 

More than one DESCRIPTION directive was encountered in a .def 
file. 


<h4>Only One NAME or LIBRARY Allowed</h4> 

More than one NAME or LIBRARY directive was detected in a .def 
file. 


<h4>Preload Segment + Relocs &gt; 64k, Use -k</h4> 

A segment marked for preloading, plus its relocation information, 
exceeds 65, 536 bytes in size. The fast-load section of a Windows 
 .exe file cannot accept segments larger than this. You can change 
the segment to movable, discardable, loadoncall, or disable segment 
sorting with -k. 


<a name="previous_definition_different"><h4>Previous Definition Different</h4></a>

	This appears as messages of the form:

	<pre>
	SNN.lib(except)  Offset 0791FH Record Type 00C3 Error 1:
	Previous Definition Different : ??1exception@std@@UAE@XZ
	(syscall std::exception::~exception(void ))
	</pre>

	It happens when a PUBLIC symbol appears more than once in the
	.obj and .lib files presented to optlink, in other words,
	the symbol is multiply defined. Multiple definitions of a PUBLIC
	symbol are an error because the linker cannot determine which
	one should be used.
	To find it, use <a href="grep.html">grep</a>
	to determine which files contain it:
	<pre>
	grep ??1exception@std@@UAE@XZ *.obj *.lib \dm\lib\*.lib
	</pre>
	If it is in a .obj file, use <a href="obj2asm.html">obj2asm</a>
	to see if it is a PUBLIC definition or not. If it is in
	a library (.lib) file, use <a href="lib.html">lib</a> to generate
	a .lst file and see which modules in the library define the
	symbol.
	Once it is clear where the multiple definitions are coming from,
	it's possible to figure out why and what to do about it.

<h4>PROT vs REAL Conflict</h4> 

A conflict between real mode and protected mode syntax was 
encountered. 


<h4>PUBDEF Must Have Segment Index</h4> 

OPTLINK encountered a PUBLIC symbol that had no reference into 
a defined SEGMENT. Most likely cause is a corrupt object file, due 
either to a disk accident or translator error. 


<h4>Relocatable Bases Not Allowed in Absolute Mode</h4> 

Reference to relocatable data was encountered while processing 
code in Absolute Mode. That is, the .obj module(s) cannot 
reference segments or groups, cannot do far jumps or calls, and 
cannot do DD LABEL, when generating a .com or .sys file, unless 
the target segment has been declared to be absolute (SEGMENT AT). 


<h4>Segment &gt;= 4G</h4> 

The total size of a 32-bit segment exceeds 4 gigabytes (" 4G"). 


<h4>Segment Size Exceeds 64k</h4> 

The total size of a segment exceeds 65, 536 bytes (" 64K"). 


<h4>SEGMENTS Directive</h4> 

A syntax error was detected in a SEGMENTS directive. 


<h4>Short JMP Out of Range</h4> 

The destination of short JMP instruction was more than 125 bytes 
from the location of the instruction. 


<h4>Start Address Must Be 100H</h4> 

The .com file option has been selected and a starting address (END 
start_addr) other than 0100h was also specified. 


<a name="symbol_undefined">
<h4>Symbol Undefined</h4>
</a>

	A symbol remained undefined after all input files, including libraries,
	had been processed. Common causes for this are:
	<ul>
	<li> A function was called in your code, but the function was
	never written.
	<li> A virtual function was declared, but never written.
	<li> A data variable was referenced, but never defined anywhere.
	<li> Did not specify all the .obj files to the linker.
	<li> The calling conventions of the function being referenced
	do not match the calling conventions of the defined function.
	Compiler switches, memory models, and special keywords can all
	affect calling convention (and thereby the name of the symbol
	as it appears in the .obj file).
	<li> One or more missing library files (.lib). One way to figure
	out which .lib file contains the missing symbol is to run:
	<pre>
	\dm\bin\grep <i>symbolname</i> \dm\lib\*.*
	</pre>
	<li> The <b>LIB</b> environment variable is missing or not pointing
	to the \dm\lib directory or wherever the .lib files reside.
	</ul>


<h4>Too Many ENTRIES</h4> 

More than 65,536 entries were specified. 


<h4>Too Much DEBUG Data for Old CodeView Format</h4> 

OPTLINK detected more than 64KB of debug information per type 
per module, and the CodeView option has been enabled for a 
CodeView version prior to 4.0. 


<h4>Unknown COMDAT Allocation Type</h4> 

Either corrupt files, translator errors, internal errors in OPTLINK, or 
unknown enhancements to the OMF conventions. If you get this 
error, please contact Digital Mars Technical Support. 


<h4>Unrecognized data in .CFG</h4> 

Syntax error within optlinks.cfg. 


<h4>Unrecognized FIXUPP Type</h4>

Most likely cause is the object file has been corrupted, or a translator 
error has occurred. 


<h4>Unrecognized Record</h4> 

A record in an object file cannot be recognized as one of the defined 
record types. The unrecognized record is skipped and linking 
continues. 


<h4>Weak EXTRN Different</h4> 

A "weak EXTERN" declared with a different default in another 
module was encountered. 


<h4>WeakLazyAlias Internal</h4> 

A specific internal error condition was detected in OPTLINK. If you 
get this error, please contact Digital Mars Technical Support. 

<hr>
<h2><a name="fatal">Fatal Error Messages</a></h2>

These prevent a successful completion of OPTLINK, 
processing stops immediately upon detection. An executable or 
possibly a partial executable may have been created. This file is 
unusable and should be deleted. 


<h4>.DEF Syntax Error</h4> 

An invalid .def file syntax could not be parsed. 


<h4>.RES File Corrupt</h4> 

The compiled resource (.res) file was found to be corrupt. To 
correct it, rebuild the file using the rc.exe resource compiler and 
its /r option switch. 


<h4>APPLOAD Must Appear Before Any Segments</h4> 

A segment precedes the APPLOADER directive in a .def file. 


<h4>Bad FIXUPP Thread</h4> 

A FIXUPP thread was referenced prior to being defined. The .obj 
file is corrupt and must be regenerated. This condition can only be 
caused by a translator error. 


<h4>Bad LOC Frame in Start Address</h4> 

An undefined FIXUPP frame was referenced in a start address. The 
object file is corrupt and must be regenerated. This condition can 
only be caused by a translator error. 


<h4>Bad OMF Extension</h4> 

The format of a type A0 COMENT record cannot be recognized. 


<h4>Bad STUB File</h4> 

An error was detected while parsing the specified STUB file. 
Indicates an invalid DOS .exe file. 


<h4>Cannot Create File</h4> 

A requested output file cannot be created. Most probable causes are 
the requested file name contains an invalid character, or the output 
disk directory is full (applicable only to root directories). 


<h4>Cannot parse Class record</h4> 

Corrupt debug information. 


<h4>Cannot Reopen Output File</h4> 

A file access error was encountered, probably due to a sharing 
violation on the output file. 


<h4>Circular ALIAS</h4> 

A chain of aliases references itself. 


<h4>Colon Expected</h4> 

An OPTLINK option that requires a number is requested, and the ":" 
or following number is not given. Try the operation again, being 
sure to supply all required numbers. 


<h4>Dictionary Exceeded 512k</h4> 

Library dictionaries have a size limit of 512Kb, which is unlikely to 
ever be reached unless the /IMPLIB switch is used incorrectly. 


<h4>Disk Full Writing</h4> 

OPTLINK failed to find enough space on the disk to write the 
required output (or virtual memory) file. 


<h4>DOS Critical Error</h4> 

DOS detects a "critical error" while processing a read or write 
function for OPTLINK. 


<h4>DOSSETFILEINFO Error</h4> 

An OS/2 critical error occurred. 


<h4>EMS Error</h4>
 
OPTLINK was notified of an EMS error while attempting to access 
expanded memory. The only known causes for this error are faults 
in either the EMS driver or the EMS hardware. 


<h4>EXPORTed Names Text &gt;64k</h4> 

The exported names text exceeds the limit. Try using the /NONAMES 
link option. 


<h4>Filename Expected</h4> 

OPTLINK failed to encounter a required file name as input. 


<h4>File Not Found</h4> 

Commands were given to perform an operation with a object file 
which cannot be found. 


<h4>Illegal Filename</h4> 

A file name cannot be parsed into a valid format. 


<h4>Illegal Record Syntax</h4> 

OPTLINK was unable to decipher the syntax of a record in an object 
file. The most likely cause is that the object file is corrupt, due either 
to a disk accident or to a translator error. 


<h4>/IMPLIB Needs Larger /PAGESIZE</h4> 

Set the /PAGESIZE link option to a larger number. 


<h4>Incremental Compile Error</h4> 

A record was detected that says the .obj file being processed is 
corrupt. Compilers such as Microsoft Quick C may create such 
records upon detecting certain errors during an incremental compile. 


<h4>Index Range</h4> 

A record in the object file provides an index value which is outside 
the allowable range of values. The most likely cause is that the 
object file is corrupt, due either to a disk accident or to a translator 
error. 


<h4>Indirect File Nested Too Deep</h4> 

The nesting level for indirect files exceeds 10. 


<h4>Limit of 65535 Base FIXUPPs Exceeded</h4> 

Attempted to created more than 65,535 relocation entries for a real-mode 
executable. This limit is imposed by the structure of the .exe 
file. 


<h4>Module or Dictionary Corrupt</h4> 

When attempting to read a .obj or .lib module, the first record 
was invalid. This error can be caused by passing some other file 
mistakenly as a .obj or .lib (syntax error). It also can be caused 
by invalid library dictionaries built by incompatible tools. 


<h4>Need Larger /ALIGNMENT Value</h4> 

The segmented (Windows or OS/ 2) executable is larger than 
64KB * ALIGNMENT. Alignment is the page boundary in the .exe or 
 .dll on which all segments will start. These segments are referred 
to elsewhere by a 16-bit page number. OPTLINK defaults to an 
ALIGNMENT of 16 (limits an executable to 1MB) to reduce wasted 
space between segments, while other linkers normally waste space 
by defaulting 512. To fix the problem, increase the ALIGNMENT size. 


<h4>No Segments Linked!</h4> 

No input files could be processed. Therefore, no file could be 
created. 


<h4>Not a Valid Library File</h4> 

A .lib file fails to meet the criteria for .lib files. 


<h4>Number Overflow</h4> 

A number greater than 65,535 (16 bits) was supplied on the 
command line. 


<h4>OBJ Record Too Long</h4> 

An object record exceeds 6000 bytes in length. The .obj or .lib 
file is probably corrupt. 


<h4>Out of Memory</h4> 

OPTLINK does not have enough memory to continue operation. 
OPTLINK needs to have a minimum of 200KB available. Try 
removing a TSR or two, and link again, or (if you are using a 
makefile) link from outside the MAKE program. 


<h4>Overflow 32-bit Multiply</h4> 

OPTLINK's far global data allocation routines encounter an address 
value which they cannot successfully calculate. While it is 
documented here for completeness, you are not likely to see this 
message. 


<h4>Selector Already Released</h4> 

As a result of an internal processing error within OPTLINK. If you get 
this error, please contact Digital Mars Technical Support. 


<h4>Swap File Full</h4> 

Virtual memory is exhausted. Delete any unnecessary files from your 
disk and try again. 


<h4>Token Too Long</h4> 

A symbol name or other token exceeds the 468-character limit. The 
 .obj or .lib file is probably corrupt. The too-long symbol is 
appended to the message. 


<h4>Too Many Relocs to EXEPACK</h4> 

More than 8,191 segment relocations per 64KB of data were involved 
while performing EXEPACK on real-mode executable. 


<h4>Too Many Segments For Segmented .EXE Format</h4> 

The segmented .exe format can hold only 254 segments. Number 
of segments has been exceeded, even after /PACKCODE and 
/PACKDATA have been used. Try using .dll's to contain some 
segments and thus reduce the size of this module. 


<h4>Too Much EXESTR Data</h4> 

More than one megabyte of EXESTR data (created by a MSC6. 0 
pragma) exists. OPTLINK supports up to one megabyte of EXESTR 
data. 


<h4>Unexpected End of File</h4> 

OPTLINK encountered the end of an input file before finding a 
MODEND record. The most likely cause is that the object file is 
corrupt, due either to a disk accident or to a translator bug. 


<h4>Unknown FIXUPP Frame Type</h4> 

OPTLINK was unable to determine the frame type of a FIXUPP 
record in an object module. Most likely cause is that the object file 
has been corrupted, or that a translator error has occurred. 


<h4>Unrecognized B2 Record</h4> 

OPTLINK found a type B2 record in its input files and was unable to 
determine the meaning of the record. Most likely cause is that the 
translator has added an undocumented extension to the B2 record 
usage. 


<h4>Unrecognized Communal Syntax</h4> 

OPTLINK detected an error while processing a type B0 (Communal 
Data) record. 


<h4>Unrecognized Record</h4> 

OPTLINK cannot recognize the type of a record in an object file. 


<h4>User ABORT</h4> 

The user pressed Control-C or Control-Break to abort the link 
operation. 


<h4>XMS Error</h4> 

OPTLINK was notified of an XMS error while attempting to access 
extended memory. The only known causes for this error are faults in 
the XMS driver.
