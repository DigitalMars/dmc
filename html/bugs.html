<h1>Bug Reports</h1>

If there is a bug in the product, please submit a bug report.
A bug would be a crash, a message about an "internal error" appears,
when the behavior of the software doesn't match
the documentation, or doesn't match the corresponding standard.
<p>

In order to submit a problem report, the most important issue is to make
it reproducible in the smallest possible example. Through years of experience,
we've found that 95% of bugs can be reproduced in 10 or fewer lines of code.
A small reproducible example makes it far easier for us to identify just
what the problem is, and what an approprate workaround or fix might be.
Often, the process of whittling the problem down to just a few lines suggests
its own workaround and so you won't be blocked by the problem while we work
on it.
<p>

Please try to eliminate from the bug report any references to source code,
headers, libraries, directories, etc., that are not included with the bug
report and are not part of the Digital Mars distribution. Include a short
.bat file which reproduces the problem.
<p>

Once the problem is packaged, post it in the appropriate Digital Mars
<a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/NewsGroup.html" title="tech support & discussion">news group</a>.
The problem may be a familiar one to other users, and so that is
the fastest way to get a workaround or help.
<p>

We understand that sometimes the source code exhibiting the problem is
proprietary, or a trade secret, or you are legally prevented from posting it.
If so, please try and reproduce the problem in a short piece of code that
would be free of such restrictions. If that is not possible, we'll be
happy to sign an NDA for the bug report. We respect our customers' privacy
and intellectual property rights; please identify any portions of the bug
report which would be subject to restrictions. Email any proprietary bug
reports to
<a href="mailto:bugs@digitalmars.com" title="bug reports">bugs@digitalmars.com</a>.
<p>

<b>Note: Digital Mars does not promise to fix any or all bugs
   or provide workarounds.</b> Any fixes, updates, or workarounds
   are made available purely at the discretion of Digital Mars.
