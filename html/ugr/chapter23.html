<h1>23. Controlling and Configuring the Debugger</h1>


This chapter describes the commands on the IDDE's <b>Debug</b> menu
that you use to run the debugger. This chapter also explains
how to use breakpoints and watchpoints effectively.
<p>

Chapter 8, "Testing an Application," presents an overview of the 
Digital Mars C++ debuggers and explains how to perform typical 
debugging tasks. 
<p>

Chapter 24, "Commands Available in Debugging Mode," describes 
the commands and the functionality of each of the debug windows 
that you can open from the Views palette. 


<h2>Commands on the Debug Menu</h2>

Debugging commands are located in the <b>Debug</b> menu on the 
IDDE's main menu bar. Figure 23-1 shows the <b>Debug</b> menu 
commands. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure23_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 23-1 Debug menu commands 
	<p>

This section describes the commands in the <b>Debug</b> menu in the 
order shown in Figure 23-1. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
Frequently used debugging commands are available 
from the Debug toolbox. See "Debug Toolbox 
Icons" in this chapter to learn how to use the Debug 
toolbox. 


<h4>Start/Restart Debugging</h4>
Starts a debugging session. During a debugging session, any open 
Source window changes from editing mode to debugging mode. In 
debugging mode you can set breakpoints, jump to a specific line, or 
view assembly instructions generated for a line of code. You cannot, 
however, edit the source code. You must exit the debugging session 
(return to the editing session) to modify the source code. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
If you need to specify command-line parameters in 
your application, you can do so in the <b>Run 
Arguments</b> dialog box, available by choosing the 
<b>Arguments</b> command from the IDDE's <b>Project</b> 
menu. 
<p>


If debugging is in progress, choosing <b>Start/Restart Debugging</b> 
restarts the application. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
If you want to run the program without debugging 
it, choose the <b>Execute Program</b> from the <b>Project</b> 
menu. 


<h4>Stop Debugging</h4>
Exits the current debugging session and switches the IDDE into 
editing mode. 


<h4>Step Into</h4>
Executes the program until it reaches the next source-level 
statement. This command lets you step through the program's code 
at the source level, statement by statement. 
<p>


If <b>Step Into</b> is used on a procedure or function call, the debugger 
steps into the first statement of the function only if tracing is enabled 
for the module containing that function. For more information, see 
"The Project Window," in Chapter 24, "Commands Available in 
Debugging Mode." 
<p>


If the Assembly window is the active window, this command 
executes to the next assembly (as opposed to source level) 
instruction. If the assembly window is open but is not the active 
window when you use this command, it updates to show the next 
instruction to be executed. 


<h4>Step Over</h4>
Executes the program to the next statement, or until a breakpoint or 
watchpoint is triggered or an exception is raised. If the current 
statement is a call to a procedure or function, the program executes 
to the next statement following the call. 
<p>


If the Assembly window is the active window, this command 
executes the program to the next assembly instruction without 
tracing into function calls. If the current instruction is a call to a 
function, the program executes to the assembly instruction following 
the call. 


<h4>Return from Call</h4>
Executes the program up to the current function's return address, or 
until a breakpoint or watchpoint is triggered or an exception is 
raised. This command is useful when executing the rest of the 
current function or procedure after having stepped into it, then 
stopping execution at the point immediately after the call was made. 


<h4>Go until Breakpoint</h4>
Executes the program until a previously set breakpoint or 
watchpoint is triggered. 


<h4>Go until Next Function</h4>
Executes the program until the entry point of the next function call is 
reached, or until a breakpoint or watchpoint is triggered or an 
exception is raised. This command is useful when executing from 
any point in a function to the next function call. 


<h4>Go until End</h4>
Executes the program to the end, ignoring any breakpoints and 
watchpoints that are set. If a Windows protection fault or other 
exception occurs, the program breaks at the point of the violation. 


<h4>Break</h4>
<b>(32-bit IDDE only)</b> Stops the process currently being debugged, and 
shows the location of the current execution point. Choosing <b>Break</b> 
is equivalent to typing CTRL+ALT+SYSREQ in a debugging session with 
the 16-bit IDDE. 


<h4>Animate</h4>
Executes the program until the next source-level statement is 
reached, waits for a short delay (the animate delay), and again 
executes the program until the next source-level statement is 
reached. This command is equivalent to repeatedly executing the 
<b>Step Into</b> command and waiting for a short delay. To stop the 
animation mode, choose <b>Stop Animate</b>. 
<p>


To set the animation delay time, choose the <b>Animate Delay</b> 
command from the <b>Settings</b> submenu of the <b>Debug</b> menu (see the 
section "Animate delay," later in this chapter). 


<h4>Stop Animate</h4>
Stops the animation mode. 


<h4>Settings</h4>
Brings up the <b>Debugger Settings</b> tabbed dialog box (Figure 23-2). 
The tabs at the top allow you to switch between the General page, 
the Exceptions page, and the Multiple EXE/ DLL page. 


<h3>General</h3>

Options on this page of the <b>Debugger Settings</b> dialog box control 
the general debugger settings, such as the animation delay. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure23_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 23-2 General page of the Debugger Settings dialog box 
	<p>


<h4>Flip screen </h4>
Specifies whether the IDDE flips control of the screen between the 
debugger and the text-mode application window each time the 
debugger executes some part of the application code. 
<p>


When Flip Screen is turned on, the application gets control of the 
screen each time it runs. When Flip Screen is turned off, the 
debugger does not activate the application to bring it to the 
foreground each time the debugger gives control to the application. 


<h4>Animate delay </h4>
Opens the <b>Animate Delay</b> dialog box. This dialog box allows you 
to specify the amount of time the debugger pauses between steps 
while in animation mode. In animation mode, the debugger executes 
the program step by step, pausing between steps by the amount of 
time you have specified. (See the section "Animate" earlier in this 
chapter for information on the <b>Animate</b> command.) 
<p>


The <b>Animate Delay</b> dialog box lets you specify the delay in 
milliseconds. For example, to pause for one second between steps, 
specify 1000; the default is one-half second (500 milliseconds) delay. 


<h4>Load symbols when editing </h4>
When this option is checked, the IDDE loads debug symbols from 
the compiled executable or the DLL when the IDDE is in editing 
mode. This gives you access to the data definitions in the Data 
Window, as well as to line number information, while editing your 
source code. For this option to work properly, you must build your 
project with debug symbols enabled. Note that in editing mode some 
of your operations in editing mode might take longer when this 
option is on because IDDE has to load the debug symbols from your 
compiled project. 

<hr>
<b>Warning:</b> No changes that you have made to the source files 
since the last time you compiled your project are 
reflected in the debug symbols shown while you 
are editing. To update the debug symbols, you must 
rebuild your project. 
<hr>

<h4>Debug application startup </h4>
Controls whether debugging starts at the beginning of a program or 
at the <tt>WinMain()</tt> or <tt>main()</tt> entry point. 
<p>


If you check this option, the debugger automatically sets a fixed 
breakpoint at the main entry point and lets you trace through the 
application's startup code. If not, the debugger starts tracing from 
<tt>WinMain()</tt> or <tt>main()</tt> onward. 


<h4>Automatic switch to debug workspace </h4>
When you check this option, the debugger automatically debugs the 
current project in the IDDE debugging workspace. 


<h4>Automatic check of project dependencies </h4>
When you check this option, the debugger automatically checks the 
project dependencies in the current project. 


<h4>Show local data on start debugging </h4>
When you check this option, the debugger automatically displays 
local data at the start of a debugging session. By default, the Data 
window shows no data. 


<h4>Enable C++ class display </h4>
Specifies whether the debugger displays C++ types in the Data/Object
window using the form <i>class::object</i>. When you do not check 
this option, the debugger does not display C++ class names in the 
Data/Object, Call, or Function windows. 


<h4>Alternate class display </h4>
Reverses the order in which C++ information is displayed in the 
Data/Object window to the form <i>object::class</i>. This command is 
disabled unless you check the Enable C++ Class Display option. 


<h4>Source search path </h4>
Specifies the search path for source files when debugging. 


<h4>Working directory </h4>
Specifies the working directory for a debugging session. 


<h3>Exceptions (32-bit IDDE only)</h3>

Options on this page let you control how the debugger responds to 
the operating system when an exception occurs. This capability 
helps you diagnose the cause of unforeseen, and possibly serious, 
errors. 
<p>


Exceptions presented on this page are NT exceptions, which are part 
of the Structured Exception Handling mechanism of Win32. NT 
exceptions comprise both hardware exceptions (such as access 
violations, division by zero, or stack overflow) and software 
exceptions (explicitly initiated either by Win32 APIs— <tt>HeapAlloc</tt>, 
for instance— or by your own code). However, C++ exceptions are 
also accommodated on the Exceptions page. When you throw a C++ 
exception in a Win32 program, an NT exception is raised. The 
exception code of the NT exception is the same value, unique to 
Digital Mars C++, regardless of which C++ exception was thrown. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
For more information on Structured Exception 
Handling, see <i>Microsoft Win32 Programmer's 
Reference, Volume 2</i>. 
<p>


You can specify whether or not the debugger should stop on a 
particular exception, or should stop only if you have not provided a 
handler for it. (Uses of these options are discussed below.) The 
Exceptions page is shown in Figure 23-3. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure23_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 23-3 Exceptions page of the Debugger Settings dialog box 

<dl>
<dt><b>Number:</b> <dd>Contains an exception code— a DWORD that uniquely 
identifies an exception. Exception codes are displayed and entered 
in the Number field as eight-digit hexadecimal numbers. Symbolic 
constants for the exception codes of predefined NT exceptions can 
be found in <tt>include\win32\winnt.h</tt>, located beneath the 
directory in which you installed Digital Mars C++. 
<p>


The layout of an exception code's 32 bits is summarized in a 
comment in the header file <tt>include\win32\winerror.h</tt>. If you 
define your own exceptions, your exception code should adhere to 
that format. 


<dt><b>Name:</b> <dd>Contains a descriptive string. No restrictions are placed on 
the contents of this field. 


<dt><b>Action:</b> <dd>This drop-down list box contains two choices: Stop if not 
Handled, and Always Stop. For both actions, the debugger stops 
before the operating system itself responds to the exception. 

<dl>
	<dt><b>Stop if not handled:</b> <dd>The debugger stops only if no 
	outstanding <tt>__try/__except</tt> or <tt>__try/catch</tt> block 
	will handle this exception. 


	<dt><b>Always stop:</b> <dd>The debugger stops, whether or not the 
	exception will be handled. 
</dl>

If you have written a handler for a particular exception, you can 
choose to always stop on that exception to determine the point at 
which it was raised. If an exception occurs that you have not 
anticipated and for which you have not written a handler, either 
Action will make the debugger stop. You can then diagnose the 
cause of the exception by examining values of variables and the call 
chain. Stop if not Handled can also be used to debug existing 
exception handlers. It assists you in diagnosing situations where an 
exception for which you have written a handler is being raised, but 
which none of your handlers is catching. 


<dt><b>Add:</b> <dd>Adds a new exception to the list contained in the main pane, 
as specified in the Number, Name, and Action fields. The Number 
field must contain a value not used by any exception already in the 
list. 


<dt><b>Replace:</b> <dd>Replaces information for the currently selected exception 
in the main pane with the contents of the Number, Name, and 
Action fields. This button is disabled if the Number field contains a 
value different from the Number (exception code) of the selected 
exception. 


<dt><b>Remove:</b> <dd>Deletes the currently selected exception from the list in the 
main pane. 


<dt><b>Reset:</b> <dd>Undoes any changes to the built-in exception entries, without 
altering any added exceptions. If any built-in exception entries have 
been deleted, they are restored; all Actions and Names for built-in 
exception entries are reset. 
</dl>

<h3>Multiple EXE/DLL debugging</h3>

Options on this page (Figure 23-4) allow you to specify how to 
debug a project with multiple executables or dynamic link libraries. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure23_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 23-4 Multiple EXE/DLL page of the Debugger Settings 

<dl>
<dt><b>Single executable:</b> <dd>Debugs only the executable file. Does not 
debug DLLs called by the executable. 

<dt><b>All loading EXE/DLLs:</b> <dd>Debugs the executable file and all DLLs or 
EXEs called or spawned by the executable, including DLLs loaded at 
run-time via explicit calls to the <tt>LoadLibrary</tt> API. 

<dt><b>Specific EXE/DLLs:</b> <dd>Debugs the executable file and specific DLLs or 
EXEs. Select those you want in the Specify Libraries and/or Modules 
to Debug portion of the dialog box (enabled only when this radio 
button is selected). 

<dt><b>Calling program:</b> <dd>For a DLL project, this textbox lets you specify 
the application that calls the DLL. 
</dl>

<h2>Debug Toolbox Icons</h2>

The Debug toolbox contains icons that correspond to the commands 
on the IDDE's <b>Debug</b> menu. Figure 23-5 shows the command that 
each icon invokes. For information on how to use these commands, 
see the previous section. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure23_5.gif" alt="Debug toolbox icons"><br>
	<small>Figure 23-5 Debug toolbox icons</small>

<h2>Working with Breakpoints</h2>

This section explains how to set and use breakpoints with the 
Digital Mars C++ debuggers. The debuggers support three types of 
breakpoints: 


<ul>
	<li> Unconditional 
	<li> Conditional 
	<li> Delayed 
</ul>


<b>Note:</b> 
Breakpoints persist across debugging sessions; the 
debuggers automatically save them to and restore 
them from project configuration files. 


<h3>Unconditional breakpoints</h3>

An unconditional breakpoint causes the debugger to stop execution 
of the program when the breakpoint is encountered. 
<p>

You set unconditional breakpoints using the <b>Set Breakpoint</b> or the 
<b>Set/Clear Breakpoint</b> command (F9) in the Source, Assembly, 
Function, Data/Object, or Breakpoint windows (as well as in the Spy 
window when debugging a Windows application). After setting an 
unconditional breakpoint, choose the <b>Go until Breakpoint</b> 
command from the IDDE's <b>Debug</b> menu to execute your program 
until it reaches the breakpoint. When the breakpoint is reached, the 
program halts and returns control to the debugger. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
While in debugging mode, you can also set an 
unconditional breakpoint by double-clicking in the 
left margin of the Source window at the line where 
you want execution to stop. 


<h3>Conditional and delayed breakpoints</h3>

Conditional breakpoints let the debugger: 

<ul>
	<li> Stop the execution of the program only when a specified 
	condition evaluates to TRUE 

	<li> Stop the execution of the program only when it 
	encounters a breakpoint a specified number of times 
	(this is a delayed breakpoint) 

	<li> Evaluate an expression at a breakpoint 

	<li> Add code to the program without recompiling 
</ul>

You can set these kinds of breakpoints using the <b>Set Conditional 
Breakpoint</b> command in the Source, Assembly, Function, or 
Breakpoint windows. After you execute this command, the <b>Set Code 
Breakpoint</b> dialog box shown in Figure 23-6 is displayed. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b>
When you choose <b>Set Conditional Breakpoint</b> in 
the Breakpoint window, the <b>Expression</b> dialog 
box is displayed first. Enter the address or 
procedure name (for example) where you want to 
set the breakpoint. The <b>Set Code Breakpoint</b> 
dialog box is then displayed to allow you to specify 
the kind of breakpoint to set. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure23_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 23-6 Set Code Breakpoint dialog box 
	<p>

The debugger automatically sets the Line, Address, and Procedure 
fields, based on the location of the breakpoint. 

<dl>
<dt><b>Limit:</b> <dd>Use this field to reach the breakpoint a specified number of 
times before the debugger stops program execution. This sets a 
delayed breakpoint. 

<dt><b>Condition:</b> <dd>Use this field when you want an expression to be 
evaluated every time execution of the program reaches this 
breakpoint. If the expression evaluates to TRUE (nonzero), the 
debugger performs the action( s) specified in the Actions group. In 
the Condition field, enter the expression to be evaluated. 


<dt><b>Evaluate:</b> <dd>Check this option if you want the debugger to evaluate 
the next field's expression whenever the program reaches this 
breakpoint. If you use the Condition field, a breakpoint is triggered 
only if the Condition evaluates to TRUE. 
<p>


This field allows you to insert into your code a statement that you 
had neglected to include, or to test (in the debugger) that a 
modification works before editing, compiling, and linking. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
Please refer to Appendix A, "Expression Evaluation,"
for more information about expressions. 
<p>


<dt><b>Break:</b> <dd>Check this option if you want the debugger to stop execution 
of the program whenever the program reaches this breakpoint. If 
you use the Condition field, the debugger stops execution on 
reaching this breakpoint only if the Condition evaluates to TRUE. 
</dl>

<h3>Examples of conditional breakpoints</h3>

The following are examples of conditional breakpoints: 

<h4>Example 1 </h4>
To execute your program to a point at which a certain condition is 
met— such as stopping the execution at this breakpoint only if the 
value of <tt>i + j</tt> is greater than <tt>2000</tt> -- execute a Set Conditional 
Breakpoint command. Specify the expression <tt>i + j &gt; 2000</tt> in the 
Condition field. 
<p>


The debugger executes your program and evaluates the condition 
every time it executes the line on which the breakpoint is set. If the 
condition specified does not evaluate to TRUE, the debugger 
continues to execute your program. As soon as the value of <tt>i + j</tt> 
exceeds <tt>2000</tt> when this line is executed, the debugger stops 
executing the program and regains control. 


<h4>Example 2 </h4>
You omitted a statement from a line in which you should have called 
the function <tt>AddRes</tt> from the module <tt>Results</tt> with the parameter 
<tt>i</tt> as defined in the current function. You can use a conditional 
breakpoint to direct the debugger to evaluate this call whenever it 
encounters the breakpoint, and to do this before this line is executed 
and without stopping execution. 
<p>

Set a conditional breakpoint on the line and specify the Evaluate 
option, as shown in Figure 23-7. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure23_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 23-7 Setting a breakpoint in your code 
	<p>

Every time the debugger reaches this line and <tt>i + j &gt; 2000</tt> is TRUE, it 
calls <tt>RESULTS.AddRes(i)</tt>. However, it does not stop executing 
your program because you did not check the Break check box. 
<p>


For information on breakpoint and watchpoint commands in 
windows, see "The Command Window," in Chapter 24, "Commands 
Available in Debugging Mode." 


<h2>Working with Watchpoints</h2>

Watchpoints are vital to debugging. A watchpoint stops program 
execution while the debugger either writes to or reads from a 
location in memory. A variable or location in memory is often 
improperly overwritten, causing the program to crash. Use 
watchpoints to find these kinds of errors. 
<p>


You can set watchpoints using the debugger. First, highlight either a 
variable in the Data/Object window or a memory location in the 
Memory window, then execute the <b>Set Watchpoint</b> command in 
that window's <b>Watch</b> menu. You need not specify an address for the 
watchpoint. The debugger sets the watchpoint on the address of the 
highlighted variable or on the highlighted location in memory. 
<p>


Digital Mars C++ uses the debugging capabilities of the 80386 and 
higher microprocessors to provide full-speed execution of 
watchpoints. These microprocessors relieve the debugger of the 
need to check for the use of watchpoint locations when certain 
instructions or functions are executed. Watchpoints implemented 
with hardware assistance are called hardware watchpoints, in 
contrast to the slower software watchpoints that debuggers must 
implement in the absence of hardware support. 


<h3>Setting watchpoints</h3>

When setting a watchpoint, the <b>Set Watchpoint</b> dialog box, shown 
in Figure 23-8, prompts for information. This dialog box displays 
the address of the watchpoint and the size of the watched area in 
bytes. It lets you set the type of access mode on which the 
watchpoint should break. You can set the watchpoint to break on 
read access, write access, or both.

You can set up to four 1-byte watchpoints. You can also set four 
2-byte watchpoints if all the addresses in memory for which the 
watchpoints are set are word aligned. 


<h3>Use watchpoints on local variables with caution</h3>

If you set a watchpoint on a stack location such as a local variable, 
the debugger displays a warning message on the status line: 

<pre>
	Warning: Setting a watchpoint on stack memory 
</pre>

Clear any watchpoint set on a local variable before the 
function to which it is local returns. Otherwise, Windows itself 
can subsequently access the location, thus triggering the watchpoint 
and possibly causing Windows to crash.
