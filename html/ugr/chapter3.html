<h1>3. Starting a Project and Defining Workspaces</h1>

This chapter describes the initial steps involved in writing an 
application: creating the project that defines your target and then 
defining workspaces used in working on a project. These topics are 
covered here in sufficient depth to get you started; more detailed 
information is presented in
<a href="chapter15.html" title="Chapter 15">More about Projects and Workspaces</a>. 


<h2>What Are Projects and Workspaces?</h2>

A project is a collection of files from which an executable or library 
is generated. The IDDE automatically generates a file (called the 
makefile) that tracks the dependencies in your project. This makefile 
is configured using the project option settings you specify. The IDDE 
executes the makefile when you build your project. File extensions 
are used to determine which tool is needed to build each 
component. Project building is discussed in
<a href="chapter8.html" title="Chapter 8">Testing an Application</a>. 
<p>

Workspaces, which are among the IDDE's most useful features, are 
window configurations used for particular tasks. To create a 
workspace, you name and save the exact arrangement of windows 
on your screen. Any time you need to perform a similar task, you 
can instantly open that workspace, with the windows organized the 
way you want them. For more information on workspaces, refer to 
<a href="chapter15.html" title="Chapter 15">More about Projects and Workspaces</a>. 


<h2>Starting a Project</h2>

This section describes how to start a new project, how to open an 
existing project, and how to edit the project contents. 

<h3>Purpose of a project</h3>

The project is central to building an application with the IDDE. A 
project is a container for the application you are building. It contains 
the various components necessary for building an application or a 
library, as well as information about how to build it. 
<p>

Projects speed development time because they let you recompile 
only the source files that have changed, or whose header files have 
changed, since the last time the project was built. For example, if 
your program has five source files and you have changed one of 
them since the last build, only that file is recompiled when you build 
the project. (You can, however, choose to recompile all the files.) 
The project management system does this by automatically analyzing 
the dependencies of the source files and constructing or updating 
the makefile each time the project is built. 


<h3>Contents of a project</h3>

A project can contain several different types of file, including C and 
C++ source, assembly language source, resource scripts, object files, 
libraries, and module definition files. And because a project is built 
in a hierarchical manner, you can include projects within projects. 
<p>

The IDDE stores information about a project on disk as a project file 
with a <tt>.prj</tt> extension. Among other information, this file includes 
a list of the source files contained in a project. When you build the 
project, the IDDE constructs a makefile (<tt>.mak</tt>)— or updates the 
existing makefile— based on the files the project contains. Project 
options are stored in an option set file (<tt>.opn</tt>) that is referenced in 
the project file. The option set file can be loaded into another 
project, making it easy to transfer all option settings from one project 
to another. 


<h3>Creating a new project</h3>

To create a new project, choose <b>New</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu. The 
<b>ProjectExpress</b> dialog box opens. ProjectExpress lets you specify 
the project name, initial project options, and initial project contents 
of the new project. The <b>ProjectExpress</b> dialog box contains four 
pages of options, described in the following sections. 

<h4>Naming the project</h4> 

Initially ProjectExpress displays the Project Name page (see 
Figure 3-1). 

<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure3_1.gif">
<p>
	[Figure 3-1 ProjectExpress Project Name page]
<p>

Select the directory in which you want to create the project from the 
Directories listbox, or click on New Directory to make a new 
directory for this project. Enter the name of the new project in the 
Project Name textbox. 
<p>

If you select Use AppExpress to create new application, then click 
on Finish, AppExpress will start. AppExpress is discussed in
<a href="chapter4.html" title="Chapter 4">Generating an Application Framework</a>.


<h4>Setting the project type</h4> 

To set the target operating system, target type, and other options, 
click on Next, or select Set project type from the left listbox, to 
switch to the Project Type page (Figure 3-2). 

<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure3_2.gif">
<p>
	[Figure 3-2 ProjectExpress Project Type page]
<p>

After the project is created, you can modify these settings by 
choosing <b>Settings</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu. These options are 
discussed in more detail in
<a href="chapter15.html" title="Chapter 15">More about Projects and Workspaces</a>. 


<h4>Adding files to the project</h4> 

To add pre-existing source, header, or other files to the new project, 
click on Next, or select Add files to project from the left listbox, to 
continue to the Project Edit page (Figure 3-3). 

<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure3_3.gif">
<p>
	[Figure 3-3 ProjectExpress Project Edit page]
<p>


If you are creating a new project, you do not need to do anything on 
this page. After the project is created, you can open a similar dialog 
box by choosing <b>Edit</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu (see the section 
"Adding and deleting project files" later in this chapter). 


<h4>Setting defines and include directories</h4> 

To define macros, specify search paths, or exclude a directory from 
parsing, click on Next, or select Initial settings, to continue to the last 
page of the <b>ProjectExpress</b> dialog box (Figure 3-4). 

<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure3_4.gif">
<p>
	[Figure 3-4 ProjectExpress Initial Settings page]
<p>

To define a macro on the compiler command line, enter the macro 
in the Defines textbox (for example, <tt>COLOR=1</tt>). Separate multiple 
macro definitions with semicolons. Type any <tt>#include</tt> file search 
paths you want on the compiler command line in the Include 
Directories textbox. Type any directories to be excluded from 
parsing in the Browser Exclude Directories textbox. (For more 
information about parsing, see
<a href="chapter5.html" title="Chapter 5">Defining Classes and Their Hierarchies</a>).
<p>

In general, you can leave these fields blank. You may change these 
options later by choosing <b>Settings</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu. 
<p>

After the project is set up the way you want, click on Finish to create 
the new project. 


<h2>Opening an Existing Project</h2>

To open a project that already exists, choose <b>Open</b> from the <b>Project</b> 
menu. The IDDE displays the <b>Open Project</b> dialog box. Select the 
desired project filename and click OK. 
<p>

IDDE lets you work with only one project at a time. If you're already 
working with a project when you open a new one, the IDDE closes 
the project in process. 
<p>

An additional method for opening existing projects is to choose one 
from the list of projects at the bottom of the <b>Project</b> menu. Projects 
are added to this menu as they're opened or created. This makes it 
easier for you to switch back and forth between projects as you 
work. 


<h3>Adding and deleting project files</h3>

To add or remove files from your project, choose <b>Edit</b> from the 
<b>Project</b> menu. The IDDE opens the <b>Edit Project</b> dialog box, shown 
in Figure 3-5. 

<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure3_5.gif">
<p>
	[Figure 3-5 Edit Project dialog box]
<p>

The Project Files listbox contains the files in your project. 

<ul>
	<li> To add a file to your project, select the file from the File 
	Name listbox and click on Add, or double-click on the 
	name of the file. 

	<li> To add all the files in the File Name listbox, click in the 
	listbox, click on Select All, and then click on Add. 

	<li> To remove a file from the project, select it from the 
	Project Files listbox and click on Remove, or double-click 
	on the name of the file. 

	<li> To remove all the files from the project, click on the 
	Project Files listbox, click on Select All, and then click on 
	Remove. 
</ul>

To make the changes to your project, click OK. To leave your project 
as it was before, click Cancel. 
<p>

After you click OK, the IDDE checks your project for dependencies 
and creates a makefile. While checking for dependencies, the IDDE 
adds the additional files it needs to build your project. For example, 
it adds all the header files that your source files reference with the 
<tt>#include</tt> directive. 


<h3>The Project window</h3>

The Project window, shown in Figure 3-6, displays a list of files in 
the current project. You can open the Project window by choosing 
<b>Project</b> from the <b>Goto View</b> submenu of the IDDE's <b>Window</b> 
menu. 

<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure3_6.gif">
<p>
	[Figure 3-6 Project window]
<p>

You can double-click on the name of a source file in the right pane 
to open that file for editing in a Source window. (See
<a href="chapter6.html" title="Chapter 6">Editing Program Code</a>,
for a description of text editing functions.) 
<p>


You can see the current project's subprojects, or open a subproject, 
by double-clicking on the project name in the left pane. 
<p>


The icon to the left of each filename indicates certain properties of 
the file. If the icon is blue, the file was explicitly added to the 
project; if the icon is gray, the file is included in the project by a 
dependency relationship or by parsing. 
<p>


The icon next to each filename contains different information during 
debugging. An asterisk indicates that the module contains debug 
information. A "T" at the right of the icon indicates that tracing is 
enabled in the module. Dots indicate that the module contains 
breakpoints: a green dot indicates enabled breakpoints, and a red 
dot indicates disabled breakpoints. 


<h3>Closing a project</h3>

To close a project that is currently open, choose <b>Close</b> from the 
<b>Project</b> menu. The project will be saved automatically. 


<h3>Importing a Microsoft or Borland project</h3>

You can import an existing Microsoft or Borland project into the 
IDDE project system, by using the other product's makefile. 
<p>

First, choose <b>Open</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu. In the "List files of type" 
listbox, choose Import Make. When you open a Microsoft or Borland 
makefile, the IDDE lets you work with it as you would a Digital Mars 
C++ project. 
<p>

To build the project with the original Microsoft or Borland makefile, 
use the Make page under the Build tab in the <b>Project Settings</b> 
dialog box (see
<a href="chapter16.html" title="Chapter 16">More about Project Build Settings</a>)
to 
call the original makefile or batch file. 


<h2>Defining Workspaces</h2>

This section describes how to set up and save your own workspaces. 


<h3>The purpose of workspaces</h3>

The IDDE's workspace feature lets you set up multiple screen 
configurations, each of which is optimized for a specific task. For 
example, you can have a workspace for editing source files, another 
for working with project resources, and another for debugging DLLs. 
You can define up to five different workspaces. 


<h3>Creating a workspace</h3>

To start a new workspace, choose <b>New</b> from the <b>Workspace</b> 
submenu of the IDDE's <b>Environment</b> menu. Type the name of the 
new workspace in the <b>Workspace Name</b> dialog box. This name 
appears in the Workspace toolbox, as shown in Figure 3-7. You can 
then configure the screen as you like by opening the windows you 
need and positioning and sizing them to suit your requirements. You 
can refine the workspace as you work; the IDDE automatically saves 
changes to a workspace configuration when you exit the workspace. 

<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure3_7.gif">
<p>
	[Figure 3-7 Workspace toolbox]
<p>

<h3>Selecting a workspace</h3>

To change workspaces, click on a tab in the Workspace toolbox, or 
choose from the list of workspaces in the <b>Environment</b> menu. 
Changing your workspace does not affect your project; it just 
changes the way information is presented on the screen. 


<h3>More options for workspaces</h3>

For more information on how to create, edit, clone, and delete 
workspaces, and to find out how to change workspace options, refer 
to
