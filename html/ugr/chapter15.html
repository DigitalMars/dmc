<h1>15. More about Projects and Workspaces</h1>

This chapter continues the discussion of projects and workspaces that 
began in Chapter 3, "Starting a Project and Defining Workspaces." 
Here you find a detailed description of all commands and options 
associated with workspaces and projects. The first part of the chapter 
discusses the <b>Environment</b> menu and workspace options; the 
remainder of the chapter covers project files, the <b>Project</b> menu, 
project options, and the Project window. 


<h2>Environment Menu Commands</h2>

The IDDE's <b>Environment</b> menu (Figure 15-1) contains commands 
with which you can modify the IDDE work environment. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-1 Environment menu commands 
	<p>

A list of available workspaces is added to the end of the 
<b>Environment</b> menu. The current workspace is checked. Choosing a 
name in this list is equivalent to clicking on the workspace tab in the 
Workspace toolbox. 

<dl>
<dt>Workspace
<dd>The <b>Workspace</b> submenu (Figure 15-2) contains commands for 
creating and editing workspaces. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-2 Workspace submenu]
	<p>

<dt>New
<dd>Opens the <b>Workspace Name</b> dialog box. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-3 Workspace Name dialog box]
	<p>

To create a new empty workspace, type a name for the workspace 
and click OK. The Build and Views toolboxes open automatically. 
<p>

The <b>New</b> command is disabled if you already have five workspaces. 
<p>

<dt>Clone
<dd>Opens the <b>Workspace Name</b> dialog box. To create a copy of the 
current workspace, type a name for the new workspace and click 
OK. 
<p>

The <b>Clone</b> command is disabled if you already have five 
workspaces. 

<dt>Delete
<dd>Deletes the current workspace from the workspace set. The last 
remaining workspace cannot be deleted. 

<dt>Rename
<dd>Opens the <b>Workspace Name</b> dialog box. Type a new name for the 
current workspace and click OK. 

<dt>Reset
<dd>Resets the current workspace to the configuration it had when you 
started the session or when you last saved it during the current 
session with <b>Save Workspace Set</b>. 

<dt>Save Workspace Set
<dd>Saves the current workspace configurations. These configurations 
can be restored with the <b>Reset</b> command. 

<dt>Environment Settings
<dd>This command opens the <b>Environment Settings</b> dialog box with 
which you specify various environment options. Two pages of 
options are available: Workspace and Color. 
</dl>

<h3>Workspace</h3>

This page (Figure 15-4) provides options for controlling workspaces. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-4 Workspace page of the Environment Settings dialog box 
	<p>

<h4>Save workspace set on exit</h4>

Saves the workspace set when the IDDE is closed. 


<h4>Open last project on launch</h4>

When the IDDE is launched, automatically opens the project that 
was open when the IDDE was last closed. 

<h3>Color</h3>

This page (Figure 15-5) provides options with which to customize 
the IDDE windows' colors. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_5.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-5 Color page of the Environment Settings dialog box 
	<p>

To change an item's color, first click on the item name. A dashed 
box appears around the item name. Then click on Change Color. 
You may then choose a new color from a Windows <b>Color</b> dialog 
box. 

<dl>
<dt>Editing/Browsing Settings 
<dd>Opens the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box, with which you 
can view and change the IDDE's editing and browsing options. For 
more information, see Chapter 19, "Class Editor Reference," Chapter 
20, "Hierarchy Editor Reference," and Chapter 21, "Text Editor 
Reference." 
</dl>

<h2>More about Projects</h2>

This section continues the discussion of projects that began in 
Chapter 3, "Starting a Project and Defining Workspaces." 


<h3>What a project contains</h3>

The project file contains a list of all the files in your project. It also 
contains information on how these files depend on one another. 
When the project manager creates a makefile (a file that builds your 
program), it uses a file's extension to decide what kind of file it is. 
The files you can put in a project are described here, along with how 
the IDDE uses them to build a program. 


<h4>C and C++ files</h4>

The IDDE compiles C and C++ source files to produce object files 
and links the object files to produce the target. 
<p>

C source files have the .c extension; C++ source files have either the 
 .cpp or the. cxx extension. When compiled, they all generate 
object (.obj) files. 


<h4>Header files</h4>
 
You do not need to add header files to a project; they are added 
automatically by the project system. See the section "Dependency 
tracking" later in this chapter. 
<p>

If you do add a header file explicitly, it is flagged automatically for 
precompilation. See the description of the Header Files page of the 
<b>Project Settings</b> dialog box in Chapter 16, "More about Project 
Build Settings." 
<p>

The header files that are included by C/C++ source files to provide 
common interface definitions are identified by the file extensions 
 .hpp, .hxx, and .h. 
<p>

In some situations, a C/C++ source file may be included by another 
source file. In this case, you probably do not want a separate object 
file created from that included source file. Do not add the file to the 
project. When you compile the target, the project system adds the 
included file but tracks it as an included object that should not be 
compiled or linked independently. 


<h4>Assembly files </h4>

Your project may contain assembly source and header files. 
Assembly language source files are identified by the file extension 
 .asm. Assembly language header files are identified by the file 
extension .inc. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
For assembly files to be built as part of a project, 
MASM must be in a directory specified by the PATH 
environment variable. For a NetBuild project, MASM 
must be in a directory specified by the PATH 
environment variable of every buildserver, and the 
buildclient. 

<h4>Object files</h4>

Your project can include pre-existing object files— files for which 
you do not have the source or that were compiled outside the IDDE. 
Such object files are identified by the file extension .obj. These 
objects are linked into your executable. 


<h4>Resource and dialog script files</h4>

Your project can include resource script files, dialog script files, and 
other binary resource files. The IDDE compiles these script files to 
produce a resource file. After the IDDE links the object files, it binds 
the resources from the resource files into the executable. 
The resource file types are:


<dl>
	<dt><b>.rc</b>
		<dd>Source scripts of resource files that are 
		compiled by the Digital Mars C++ resource 
		compiler 

	<dt><b>.ico, .cur, .bmp</b>
		<dd>Binary resources 

	<dt><b>.res</b>
		<dd>Compiled binary resources 
</dl>

<h4>Libraries</h4>

Your project can include libraries. The IDDE links the libraries with 
the project's object files to produce the executable file. If your 
program uses a dynamic link library (DLL), don't add the DLL to the 
project file. Instead, add the DLL's import library (.lib). 
<p>

Libraries or library interfaces to a DLL that you want to link into your 
executable are identified by the file extensions .lib. 


<h4>Linker definition files</h4>

Your project can include a linker definition (sometimes called 
module definition) file. Use a linker definition file to indicate to the 
linker how to build a library or executable. These files are identified 
by the file extension .def. 
<p>

If you have your own .def file, you can include it in the project. 
The IDDE automatically modifies the .def file to change a linker 
option if necessary. If you do not specify a .def file, one is 
generated and maintained automatically for you. 


<h4>Project files</h4>

The IDDE automatically generates and maintains project files. Project 
files can be nested to form a hierarchical project structure. Project 
files are identified by the file extension .prj. 


<h4>Option set</h4>

You can include your own option set. Option sets that you create are 
identified by the file extension .opn. 


<h4>Batch and makefiles</h4>

You can include a batch or makefile. Batch files are identified by a 
 .bat file extension, and makefiles by a .mak file extension. 
<p>

When you add a batch file or a makefile to a project, the <b>Build
Order</b> dialog box (accessible via the Build Order button on the 
Make page under the Build tab of the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog box) 
becomes available to specify when to execute your batch files and 
makefiles. 


<h3>Project-generated files</h3>

The project system generates and maintains files with these
extensions:

<dl>
	<dt><b>.prj</b>
		<dd>The project file that contains information 
		on the base directory of the project, the 
		option set, the Version Control System 
		(VCS) configuration location, and each 
		of the files and its attributes. 

	<dt><b>.mak</b>
		<dd>The makefile generated from the project 
		options and files. You don't have to 
		write and maintain a makefile— the 
		project system does it for you. 

	<dt><b>.def</b>
		<dd>The linker definition (module definition) 
		file. You can specify your own .def file 
		or let the project system generate and 
		maintain one for you. 

	<dt><b>.dep</b>
		<dd>The file that keeps the dependency 
		listing. 

	<dt><b>.opn</b>
		<dd>The file in which project options are 
		stored. 

	<dt><b>.lnk</b>
		<dd>A resource file that directs the linker to 
		build your target. It is generated and 
		maintained by the project system. 
</dl>


<h3>Hierarchical project structure</h3>

You can include projects within projects (to any depth) to create a 
hierarchical project structure. Hierarchical projects have many uses. 
<p>

You can use hierarchical projects if you need to build more than one 
target as part of a system. For example, if your system includes an 
executable and a DLL, you can create a separate project for the DLL 
and include this new subproject in the master project. The library is 
built automatically when (and if) necessary. (Note that, since 
Windows relies on the module name to determine the uniqueness of 
modules, you need to give your targets different names. For 
example, do not name the executable generated by a project 
mymod.exe and name a DLL created by a subproject mymod.dll; 
an error results.) 
<p>

In other cases, some files may need different compiler settings. You 
have two options. You can put those files in a separate subproject, 
setting compile options for the project as necessary. Or, you can 
override compile options on a file-by-file basis. To do this, right-click 
on the file in the Project window, and choose <b>Settings</b> from the 
pop-up menu. You can then set compile options for that file. 
<p>

If you have a special preprocessing or translation step in your build 
process, you can create a subproject (a project within another 
project) for that make step. To accomplish the preprocessing, use 
the Make page under the Build tab in the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog 
box (see Chapter 16, "More about Project Build Settings") to call your 
own makefile or batch file. 
<p>


Use hierarchical projects to handle different releases or versions of a 
project. To build all the variants in one simple step, create a master 
project that contains only projects. When you build the master, each 
of the variants is built. 
<p>


These examples show that the hierarchical project system can be 
used in a variety of ways to customize the build process. Note that 
dependency tracking still works for subprojects— they are built as 
needed, before the master project is built. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
When you build a project that has a hierarchical 
structure, all subprojects are rebuilt with either the 
Debug or Release setting, whichever is applied to 
the master project. To ensure that each subproject is 
linked with the correct libraries (Debug or Release), 
you need to rebuild each subproject's .lnk file. 


<h3>Dependency tracking</h3>

The project system automatically tracks dependencies among the 
components of a project. Dependency information is updated with 
each successive compilation. As you add or remove include files, for 
example, the corresponding dependencies are updated. You have 
the option of turning this tracking off. 
<p>

The IDDE also tracks changes made to build options and determines 
how much of the project needs to be rebuilt based on those 
changes. For example, if you change a compiler setting, all the 
sources are rebuilt. If you change a resource compiler option, only 
the resource compiler and link steps are executed. If you change a 
link option or library directory, only the linker is run. By tracking 
these changes, the project system supports efficient and accurate 
builds. 
<p>

In the Windows 3.1 version of the IDDE, the project system can track 
files in the project with respect to version control. For more 
information on project and source code control, see Chapter 22, 
"Using Version Control." 


<h3>Project menu commands</h3>

The IDDE's <b>Project</b> menu (see Figure 15-6) contains commands to 
create, open, edit, and close projects; to build projects, to run the 
application; and to set project options. At the end of the menu, the 
IDDE adds the names of the most recently opened projects so that 
you can switch between projects as you work. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-6 Project menu commands]
	<p>
<dl>

<dt>New
<dd>Opens the <b>ProjectExpress</b> dialog box, as described in Chapter 3, 
"Starting a Project and Defining Workspaces." 

<dt>Open
<dd>Opens the <b>Open Project</b> dialog box, as described in Chapter 3, 
"Starting a Project and Defining Workspaces." 

<dt>Edit
<dd>Opens the <b>Edit Project</b> dialog box, as described in Chapter 3, 
"Starting a Project and Defining Workspaces." 

<dt>Close
<dd>Closes the current project. 

<dt>Build
<dd>Builds your project. The IDDE examines all files in the project to 
determine whether they are up-to-date and recompiles only the 
necessary files. 

<dt>Stop Build
<dd>Stops a build in progress. You can also stop a build by choosing 
<b>Stop!</b> from the Output window's menu bar. 

<dt>Rebuild All
<dd>Rebuilds all files in your project, regardless of whether they are 
up-to-date. 

<dt>Link
<dd>Links all object files and libraries. Use <b>Link</b> instead of <b>Build</b> when 
adding .lib or .obj files to a project or subtracting them from a 
project. You can also use this command if you know all files are up-to-
date. There is no dependency checking with Link, so linking is 
faster than building. Also, you would use <b>Link</b> rather than <b>Build</b> if 
you changed source code but you wanted to generate an .exe with 
existing .obj files. 

<dt>Execute Program
<dd>Executes your application. Command-line arguments may be set 
with the <b>Arguments</b> command. 

<dt>Arguments
<dd>Opens the <b>Run Arguments</b> dialog box (Figure 15-7). 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-7 Run Arguments dialog box 
	<p>

Type the command-line arguments that you want passed to an 
application when you choose <b>Execute Program</b>. 
<p>

<dt>Settings
<dd>Opens the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog box. This dialog box lets you set 
project options that specify how the IDDE builds a project. The 
following pages are available by clicking on the tabs at the top of the 
dialog box: Target, Build, Option Sets, VCS, and Directories. 

</dl>

<h3>Target settings</h3>

The options on the Target page (Figure 15-8) specify the target and 
platform for your project. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_8.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-8 Target page of the Project Settings dialog box 
	<p>

<h4>Operating system</h4>

This set of options determines the target system for your project. 
Depending on the selection of the target system, different Target 
Type options become available. The target system can be one of the 
following: 

<ul>
	<li> Windows 95 
	<li> Windows NT 
	<li> Win32s 
	<li> Windows 3.1 
	<li> DOS 
	<li> DOSX 
</ul>

All the systems are self-explanatory except DOSX. This option selects 
the DOSX 32-bit DOS Extender (which comes with Digital Mars C++) 
as the target operating system. 


<h4>Target type</h4>

This set of options determines what your project will actually be: an 
executable, a library, a Windows DLL, or a simple console. The 
target type can be one of the following: 

<dl>
<dt>Executable
<dd>Builds an executable program (.exe). 
Dynamic Link Library: Builds a Windows DLL. This option is not 
available when Operating System is set to DOS or DOSX. 

<dt>Static library
<dd>Builds a static library (.lib) -- that is, a library a 
program links to at compile time— as opposed to DLL, which links at 
run-time. 

<dt>COM
<dd>Builds a DOS executable .com file. This option is only 
available when Operating System is set to DOS. 

<dt>Console
<dd>Builds a Windows console program. In Windows 3.1 (and 
Win32s) this creates an SDI application in which the standard input 
and output functions are carried out through the SDI window. In 
Windows 95 and Windows NT, this creates an executable that runs 
as a console application, simulating an old-style teletype. 
</dl>

<h4>Uses</h4>

These options let you select the extension libraries that are linked to 
the executable. 

<dl>
<dt>MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class Library)
<dd>Links the libraries needed 
for an application that uses classes from the MFC. Two methods of 
linking are available: static library (.lib) or dynamic link library 
(DLL). 

<dt>OLE (Object Linking and Embedding)
<dd>Links the libraries needed for 
creating an application that uses OLE. 

<dt>VBX (Visual BASIC Control)
<dd>Links the libraries needed to create a 
Visual Basic control. 

<dt>OCX (OLE Control)
<dd>Links the libraries for building an OLE control. 

<dt>ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
<dd>Links the libraries needed to 
access an ODBC data source. 
</dl>

<h4>Project settings</h4>

Two options determine whether debugging information is included 
in the executable. 

<dl>
<dt>Debug
<dd>The executable contains debugging information and can be 
debugged by the IDDE debugger. 

<dt>Release
<dd>The executable contains no debugging information. It 
cannot be debugged. 
</dl>

<h4>Allow project to be built</h4>

If this option is selected, the application can be built. Deselect this 
option if a project should not be built (for example, if you don't 
want a subproject rebuilt when you choose <b>Rebuild All</b> in the 
parent project). 


<h4>Parse for browsing</h4>

If this option is selected, the project is automatically parsed. Deselect 
if you don't want the Browser to parse the source code. See Chapter 
5, "Defining Classes and Their Hierarchies," for more information. 


<h3>Build settings</h3>

The options on the Build page control how your project is compiled 
and linked. See Chapter 15, "More about Projects and Workspaces." 


<h3>Option sets</h3>

The Option Sets page (Figure 15-9) lets you save and retrieve project 
options. This feature makes it easy to define options once for a 
particular kind of target and apply them later to another project. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure15_9.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 15-9 Option Sets page of the Project Settings dialog box 
	<p>

When you exit the IDDE or close a project, current options are saved 
in the project option file (. opn). This file has the same name as the 
project. For example, if the project name is test. prj, the option 
set associated with that project is named test. opn. 
<p>

The list of option sets includes sets you define and several 
predefined option sets. Click on an option set name to select the 
option set; double-click on an option set name or click on Load to 
load the option set. 
<p>

The predefined option sets are useful starting points for defining 
your own custom options. When you load one of these option sets, 
save any changes to another option set so the defaults are intact for 
later use. These option sets are named according to the target type 
and whether debugging information is placed in the executable. 
<p>

The four buttons on the dialog box have the following functions: 

<dl>
<dt>Load
<dd>Loads the selected option set.

<h4>Include directories</h4>
Specifies directories to be searched for included files. You may 
specify multiple directories by separating each pathname with a 
semicolon. These directories are searched after those specified by 
the INCLUDE environment variable. 


<h4>Library directories</h4>
Specifies which directories to search for libraries. You may specify 
multiple directories by separating each pathname with a semicolon. 
These directories are searched after those specified by the LIB 
environment variable. 


<h4>Compiler output directory</h4>
Specifies the directory in which object files (.obj) are placed. 


<h4>Target output directory</h4>
Specifies the directory in which the linked target is placed. 


<h4>Browser exclude directories</h4>
Specifies the directories that are excluded from parsing by the 
browser. Use this option, for example, to exclude the MFC header 
file directory, and thus prevent the display of MFC classes in the 
Class and Hierarchy editors. 


<h4>Source search path</h4>
Specifies which directories to search for source files while 
debugging. 



<h2>The Project Window</h2>

This section describes all the menu commands available from the 
Project window. 

<h3>Parse menu commands</h3>

The <b>Parse</b> menu (Figure 15-11) contains commands to control the 
parsing of source files. Parse information (information about the 
project's C++ classes and class members) is stored in a global pool 
that is accessible to and used by the Class and Hierarchy Editors.

<h3>Project window mouse functions</h3>

Use the mouse to open projects, select project files, open source 
windows, drag project files to other windows, open pop-up menus, 
and change the relative sizes of the right and left panes. 
<p>

To resize the panes, first position the cursor on the dividing line 
between panes. The cursor changes to a two-headed arrow. Then 
click the left mouse button and drag the separator to the desired 
location. 
<p>

The right mouse button opens the pop-up menus (see the sections 
"Project window left pane pop-up menu commands" and "Project 
window right pane pop-up menu commands" earlier in this chapter). 
<p>

Click on a project or subproject in the left pane to open that project. 
Double-click on the current project in the left pane to toggle 
(expand or collapse) the display of its subprojects. 
<p>

Click on a project file in the right pane to select it. Double-click on a 
file in the right pane, or drag it to an empty part of the workspace, to 
open the Source window to view and edit the file. (Double-clicking 
on a subproject in the right pane opens that subproject.) 
<p>

You can drag files from the right pane to Source windows, Function 
windows, Data/ Object windows, and Assembly windows. 
<p>

Finally, to eliminate a column of information from the right pane, 
click on the title at the top of the column and drag it outside the 
column heading area. Columns of information are restored from the 
"..." pop-up menu, to the right of the column titles. To rearrange 
columns of information, drag the title at the top of the column to a 
new position. You can make columns wider or narrower by 
dragging the column title's right edge to the right or left. Clicking on 
a column title re-sorts the list of project files according to that 
column.
