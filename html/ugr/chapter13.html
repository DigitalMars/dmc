<h1>13. Lesson 4: Add Messages with ClassExpress</h1>

In Lessons 2 and 3, you learned how to generate an application 
framework and customize its user interface. However, the behavior 
of the resulting application is still generic, because it is supplied 
entirely by methods of MFC base classes. The inherited methods that 
handle Windows messages, in particular, often do nothing more than 
call DefWindowProc. 
<p>

In this lesson, you use ClassExpress to expand the functionality of 
the TML Reader and add member functions that handle Windows 
messages announcing user actions. Member functions that handle 
Windows messages are called message handlers, or just handlers. 
You can think of them as callbacks, which are called by MFC when 
the message they are intended to process is received. A message 
handler is called in response to only one message. 
<p>


The Windows message stream is the lifeblood of a Windows 
application, regardless of whether the application is constructed in 
an object-oriented or a procedural way. A well-behaved Windows 
application can interact with the user only if it taps into the message 
stream and responds to messages in nondefault ways. Using 
ClassExpress to add MFC message handlers demonstrates how easy it 
is to enhance the behavior of your MFC application. 
<p>


In this lesson, you: 

<ul>
	<li> Launch ClassExpress from the IDDE 
	<li> Use ClassExpress to add message handlers 
	<li> Edit message handlers in the IDDE Source window 
	<li> Rebuild and run the application 
</ul>

At the conclusion of this lesson, you will have: 

<ul>
	<li> Seen how Windows messages are handled in an MFC 
	application 

	<li> Used ClassExpress to perform the purely administrative 
	chores associated with handling Windows messages 
</ul>


The next section provides a brief introduction to Windows message 
handling in MFC to help you understand how messages are handled 
in TML Reader. 


<h2>Windows Message Handling in MFC</h2>

Regardless of how it is written, a Windows application receives 
messages that inform it of user actions and their consequences, 
changes in the state of other applications, or changes in the state of 
Windows itself. MFC transforms this message-driven model into the 
object-oriented model defined by its class hierarchy, thereby 
introducing several improvements to the design of applications. To 
discuss this transformation and its benefits, it is necessary first to 
review how messages are handled in a traditional Windows 
program, and to identify the shortcomings of that approach. 


<h3>Message handling in a traditional Windows application</h3>

In a traditional Windows program written in C, you handle a 
Windows message by adding code directly to the window procedure 
to which that message is dispatched by your application's message 
loop. The window procedure usually consists of a large switch 
statement whose cases are different messages. 
<p>


For example, to handle the WM_SIZE message, you must add a 
<tt>case WM_SIZE</tt> to the <tt>switch</tt>.
The statements following that <tt>case</tt> 
statement must have to unpack and coerce the window procedure's 
parameters, <tt>wParam</tt> and <tt>lParam</tt>, into constituent parts in a way 
that is specific to the WM_SIZE message. The result would look 
much like the following: 

<pre>
	LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) 
	{
	    // local and static variables... 
	    switch (msg)
	    {   
		// ... 
		case WM_SIZE:
		{   
		    UINT nType = (UINT) wParam;
		    int cx = LOWORD(lParam); 
		    int cy = HIWORD(lParam);
		    // Now do what you really want to do 
		    // ...
		} 
		break; 
		// ... 
		default:
		    break; 
	    } 
	    return DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam); 
	} 
</pre>


The <tt>switch</tt> statement usually sprawls across several pages, and the 
bodies of <tt>case</tt> statements often spill over the right margin of the 
page. Data that must be preserved across messages or shared 
between cases is usually stored in automatic or static variables visible 
to every <tt>case</tt>. The result enjoys none of the benefits of 
encapsulation or data hiding afforded by C++, and it is difficult to 
read, comprehend, and maintain. 


<h3>MFC's design</h3>

In MFC, window procedures are part of MFC itself; you do not edit 
them. Instead, the window procedures route each message to a 
handler— a member function of some class— whose purpose is to 
process that message. MFC provides default handlers, which 
collectively define the default behavior of an MFC application. You 
supply handlers only for those messages you want to process. Each 
handler you supply is a member function of one of your derived 
classes and overrides the inherited handler in the base class. 
<p>

However, you will sometimes find that your handler can call the 
inherited handler to perform the bulk of its work. 
<p>


For example, to handle the WM_SIZE message, use ClassExpress to 
add a handler for this message to your View class. (By convention, 
the handler for the WM_SIZE message is named <tt>OnSize</tt>.) 
Whenever a WM_SIZE message is received by a window represented 
by an object of your View class, your handler is called. The 
prototype of this handler is as follows: 

<pre>
	void OnSize(UINT nType, int cx, int cy); 
</pre>

Notice that the parameters of <tt>OnSize</tt> contain the same information 
that the WM_SIZE message bears in the <tt>wParam</tt> and <tt>lParam</tt> 
window procedure arguments, but in an immediately usable form. 
No unpacking or typecasting is required. In general, the signature of 
each handler— its return type, the number of its arguments and their 
types— is specific and appropriate to the message it processes. MFC 
parses the messages before calling the handler. 
<p>


To route Windows messages to handlers, MFC consults tables, called 
message maps, that pair Windows messages with the member 
functions that handle them. You never have to edit message maps 
manually because AppExpress and ClassExpress create and maintain 
them for you. AppExpress creates message maps when you generate 
an application framework. Their definitions are placed in the 
implementation (<tt>.cpp</tt>) files of your derived classes. When you use 
ClassExpress to add a handler to a class, the message map is updated 
automatically with a new entry associating the chosen message with 
your handler. Furthermore, ClassExpress adds a prototype for the 
new handler to the class's header file and inserts a stub for the 
member function into the implementation file. All you need to do is 
to add code to the body of the handler. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
This introduction to MFC message handling has 
necessarily been brief and has glossed over several 
topics you will want to learn more about. For a 
definitive discussion of how MFC works, see the 
expository chapters of the <i>Microsoft Foundation 
Class Library Reference</i>. 
<p>

Because you used AppExpress in Lesson 2 to generate an application 
framework for the TML Reader, message maps have already been 
created for your derived classes. During the course of this lesson, 
ClassExpress updates them. ClassExpress can be run either 
separately— from a Program Manager icon— or from within the 
IDDE. Because you will be using the Source window to edit the 
code that ClassExpress generates, you will launch ClassExpress from 
within the IDDE. 


<h2>Launching ClassExpress</h2>

To launch ClassExpress from the IDDE: 

<ol>
	<li> If you are not already in the IDDE, launch it. 

	<li> Open the project <tt>tmlread.prj</tt> in directory 
	<tt>samples\tutorial\lesson4\start</tt>. 

	<li> Choose <b>ClassExpress</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu. This 
	launches ClassExpress and automatically loads the 
	project <tt>tmlread.prj</tt>. 
</ol>


The ClassExpress window features a multipage interface. Its left 
column presents a list of the six different pages that can be displayed 
in the area to the right. You will work on the Message Maps page, 
which is selected automatically when you launch ClassExpress. The 
ClassExpress window is displayed, as in Figure 13-1. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure13_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 13-1 ClassExpress, displaying the Message Maps page]
	<p>


<h3>The lists on the Message Maps page</h3>

The drop-down combobox at the top of the page labeled Class 
contains a list of all derived classes in the TML Reader application. 
The class selected here directly determines the contents of two lists 
beneath it— those labeled Control IDs in Class and Function Name. 
<p>


The list labeled Control IDs in Class contains an entry for the class 
itself, as well as the names of any commands and controls that the 
selected class could potentially handle. 
<p>


The list labeled Function Name contains a list of message handlers 
already generated for the selected class by AppExpress. These 
methods are referenced in the class's message map. 
<p>


The contents of the list labeled Windows Messages depends on what 
you select in the Control IDs in Class list. If you select the class name 
in the Control IDs list, then the Windows Messages list contains a list 
of Windows messages. However, if you select a control ID, the 
Windows messages list contains notification messages appropriate to 
that type of control. If you select a command ID (usually 
corresponding to a menu item), the rightmost list contains names of 
potential message map entries for commands. 
<p>


Because the TML Reader handles messages that signal user input, the 
handlers must be added to the class corresponding to the window 
that receives those messages. Thus, you will add the handlers to the 
View class, <tt>CTMLReadView</tt>. 


<h2>Adding Message Handlers</h2>

The requirements of the TML Reader dictate the messages you will 
add handlers for. 

<dl>
	<dt><b>WM_SIZE</b>
	<dd>Detect when the window is resized, so it can recompute word-wrapping 

	<dt><b>WM_VSCROLL</b>
	<dd>Permit scrolling through a document using the vertical scrollbar 

	<dt><b>WM_KEYDOWN</b>
	<dd>Permit scrolling through a document using the keyboard 

	<dt><b>WM_SETCURSOR</b>
	<dd>Change the cursor when it is positioned over a hyperlink 

	<dt><b>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</b>
	<dd>Detect clicks on hyperlink jumps so it can change its display 

	<dt><b>WM_ERASEBKGND</b>
	<dd>Repaint the window background 
</dl>

<h3>Adding a handler for WM_SIZE</h3>

To add a handler for WM_SIZE to your View class: 

<ol>
	<li> From the drop-down list labeled Class, select the name 
	of the View class, <tt>CTMLReadView</tt>. 

	<li> Use the scrollbar to move through the Windows 
	messages list until the message WM_SIZE is visible. 

	<li> Double-click on WM_SIZE. 
</ol>


Notice that a new entry appears in the Function Name list: 

<pre>
	afx_msg void OnSize(UINT nType, int cx, int cy); 
</pre>

This is the prototype of a handler for the WM_SIZE message, as it 
would appear within a class declaration. 
<p>

Also notice that a solid square appears to the left of the message 
name, WM_SIZE, indicating that a handler now exists for that 
message. 
<p>


The ClassExpress window is displayed, as in Figure 13-2. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure13_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 13-2 ClassExpress after adding a WM_SIZE handler]

<h3>Adding other message handlers</h3>

Follow the procedure described in Steps 2 and 3 in the previous 
section to add a handler for each of the messages WM_VSCROLL, 
WM_KEYDOWN, WM_SETCURSOR, WM_LBUTTONDOWN and 
WM_ERASEBKGND: use the scrollbar of the Windows messages list to 
scroll to the message, then double-click on the message. Again, 
notice that for each message you double-click on, a new prototype is 
added to the Function name list, and a solid square appears to the 
left of the message name. 


<h3>What you have just done</h3>

When you add a handler for a message WM_<i>messagename</i>, 
ClassExpress generates code in three places. 

<ul>
	<li> The prototype for the handler is added to the declaration 
	of the selected class, and the handler becomes a 
	protected member function. 

	<li> An entry ON_WM_<i>messagename</i>() is added to the 
	message map for the class in that class's implementation 
	file. 

	<li> A stub function is created for the handler in the 
	implementation file. The body of the function just calls 
	the base class handler, and contains the comment: 

	<pre>
	// TODO: Add your message handler code here and/or call default 
	</pre>
</ul>

For example, when you add a handler for WM_SIZE, ClassExpress 
generates the following: 

<ul>
	<li> The prototype for <tt>OnSize</tt> is added to the declaration of 
	the class <tt>CTMLReadView</tt> in <tt>tmlrdvw.h</tt>. 

	<li> An entry <tt>ON_WM_SIZE()</tt> is added to the message map 
	for the class <tt>CTMLReadView</tt> in its implementation file, 
	<tt>tmlrdvw.cpp</tt>. 

	<li> A stub function for <tt>CTMLReadView::OnSize</tt> is added 
	to the file <tt>tmlrdvw.cpp</tt>. The body of the function just 
	calls the base class handler <tt>CView::OnSize</tt>. 
</ul>


Now, whenever a <tt>CTMLReadView</tt> window receives a WM_SIZE 
message, the member function <tt>OnSize</tt> is called to handle it. 


<h2>Saving Your Work</h2>

To save your work and return to the IDDE, click Close at the bottom 
of the ClassExpress window. 
<p>

Clicking Close updates your project files and returns you to the 
IDDE. To observe the handlers in action and confirm that they are 
indeed called when you expect them to be, you can add code that 
notifies you when they are called. 


<h2>Adding Code to Handlers</h2>

To add code to the OnLButtonDown and OnSize handlers, follow 
these steps: 

<ol>
	<li> Open the file <tt>tmlrdvw.cpp</tt> in a Source window. 

	<li> Find the function <tt>CTMLReadView::OnLButtonDown</tt>. 

	<li> Add the following line to the top of the function:

	<pre>
	AfxMessageBox("Left button clicked!"); 
	</pre>

	<li> Now find the function <tt>CTMLReadView::OnSize</tt>. 

	<li> Add the following line to the top of the function: 

	<pre>
	::MessageBeep(-1); 
	</pre>

	<li> Type Ctrl+S to save your changes. 
</ol>

After the project is rebuilt, you'll want to confirm that the appropriate 
statement executes whenever you click in the client area or resize 
the window. 


<h2>Building and Running the Project</h2>

To see the effect of what you've done, perform these steps: 

<ol>
	<li> Choose <b>Build</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu to update the 
	executable. 

	<li> Choose <b>Execute Program</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu to 
	run the program. 

	<li> With the mouse cursor in the client area of the program's 
	window, press the left mouse button. A box containing 
	the message "Left button clicked!" is displayed 
	(Figure 13-3). This message is displayed each time you 
	press the left mouse button in the client area. It is not 
	displayed when you release the left mouse button, move 
	the mouse, or click with the right mouse button. To 
	remove the message box, click OK. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure13_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 13-3 TML Reader running, with message box displayed]
	<p>

	<li> Now resize the window by dragging a corner of the 
	window's border to a different position. You hear a beep 
	when you release the mouse button. 
	<p>

	<b>Note:</b> 
	You will already have heard beeps during the initial 
	sequence of messages received by the View 
	window. This is normal: the window receives 
	multiple WM_SIZE messages early in its life-cycle. 
	<p>

	<li> After you have confirmed to your satisfaction that the 
	handlers are called when, and only when, they ought to 
	be called, quit the program by choosing <b>Exit</b> from 
	TMLRead's <b>File</b> menu. 
</ol>


<h2>Summary</h2>

In this lesson, you have learned: 

<ul>
	<li> How Windows messages are handled in an MFC 
	application 

	<li> How to launch ClassExpress from the IDDE and use it to 
	add message handlers 

	<li> How to verify that the message handlers are called in 
	response to the messages they handle 
</ul>


In the next lesson, you implement a <b>Preferences</b> dialog box. You 
learn how MFC and ClassExpress make it easy to create a dialog box, 
validate its data, and exchange data between the dialog box and 
your application. In TML Reader's present state, the only preference 
one could have would be for the application to actually do 
something. Toward that end, we have added code to the result of 
this lesson so that your starting point in the next lesson is a 
functioning TML Reader.
