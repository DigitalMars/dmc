<h1>9. Introduction to the Tutorial</h1>

Welcome to Digital Mars C++. This section of the manual 
contains a tutorial designed to introduce you to the important 
components and features of the Integrated Development and 
Debugging Environment (<b>IDDE</b>) -- the "shell" within which most of 
your application development takes place. 
<p>

The tutorial is designed to complement Part Two, <i>"Creating an 
Application with Digital Mars C++."</i> The tutorial provides a quick tour 
of the IDDE that shows you how to perform the most common tasks. 
Part Two contains more in-depth information, to show you 
procedures for less common tasks and alternative ways of 
accomplishing things. 


<h2>Prerequisite Knowledge</h2>

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Windows 
environment -- that you can start applications from the Program 
Manager, move and resize windows, operate menus and dialog 
boxes, and perform simple text editing tasks (such as cut, copy, and 
paste). The tutorial also assumes some familiarity with C, C++, and 
Windows programming basics. You need not know anything about 
the Microsoft Foundation Class (<b>MFC</b>) library; MFC basics are 
introduced here. 
<p>


For more information, consult the references listed in Chapter 1, 
<a href="chapter1.html">Introducing Digital Mars C++</a>. 


<h2>The Tutorial Application</h2>

The application built in the tutorial lets you read and navigate 
through hypertext. Two versions are built: a DOS version (in Lesson 
1) and a Windows 3.1 version (in Lessons 2-5). Most of the code for 
the application has been written; the tutorial just shows you certain 
stages in the development process to familiarize you with IDDE 
tools. 
<p>

The hypertext files that the tutorial applications accept as input are 
text files containing simple commands that control document 
formatting and show images as well as commands that define links 
to other such documents. The markup language recognized by the 
tutorial applications, referred to throughout the tutorials as TML, is a 
subset of the Hypertext Markup Language (<b>HTML</b>). HTML is a format 
that has become a standard for information interchange on the 
World-Wide Web (<b>WWW</b>), a distributed hypermedia system 
accessible through Internet connections. 
<p>


Special WWW browser programs enable users worldwide to access 
and share text, graphics, audio, and other data. The tutorial 
applications only hint at the richness of full-featured WWW 
browsers. The DOS TML Reader built in Lesson 1 is called TMLDOS; 
the Windows version of Lessons 2 through 5 is called TMLRead. 


<h3>Tutorial Structure</h3>

The tutorial comprises five lessons that include instructions for 
performing various tasks. Following these instructions will teach you 
basic procedures and familiarize you with IDDE tools. Each lesson 
builds on concepts and procedures introduced in previous lessons, 
so it is best to work through the lessons in order. 

<ul>

	<li>
	<a href="chapter10.html">Lesson 1</a>
	teaches you the basics: how to start the <b>IDDE</b>, open <b>Source</b> 
	windows for editing text, and compile and run a program. In 
	addition, the first lesson shows you how to run in debugging mode 
	and perform fundamental debugging tasks. The example program in 
	Lesson 1 is a DOS application; however, the skills you learn are 
	equally applicable to Windows application development. 
	<p>


	<li>
	<a href="chapter11.html">Lesson 2</a>
	shows you how to use <b>AppExpress</b> to generate an 
	application framework for a Windows program. You also learn to 
	use precompiled headers and to use <b>TRACE</b> calls within your 
	program to track its progress. Lesson 2 concludes with a brief 
	introduction to <b>MFC</b> and describes the classes that constitute the 
	application framework you generated. 
	<p>


	<li>
	<a href="chapter12.html">Lesson 3</a>
	Lesson 3 teaches you how to use the <b>ResourceStudio</b>. You modify 
	the menu and accelerator table generated by <b>AppExpress</b>, and attach 
	a new toolbar bitmap to your application's resources. You then edit 
	the source code to make use of the new toolbar. 
	<p>


	<li>
	<a href="chapter13.html">Lesson 4</a>
	shows you how to use <b>ClassExpress</b> to add message 
	handlers to your application. You add handlers for Windows 
	messages, such as scrolling, mouse button clicks, and keypresses, 
	then monitor the message handlers as the application framework 
	calls them. 
	<p>


	<li>
	<a href="chapter14.html">Lesson 5</a>
	returns to the <b>ResourceStudio</b>, with which you add a menu 
	item to open a simple <b>Preferences</b> dialog box. You use 
	<b>ClassExpress</b> to create a new class for the dialog box and add 
	message handlers. Finally, you add code to connect the menu item 
	to the dialog box and to exchange information between the dialog 
	box and the main program. 

</ul>

<h3>Tutorial Source Code</h3>

The source code for the tutorial is located in <tt>samples\tutorial</tt>, 
under the directory in which you installed Digital Mars C++ (by default, 
this is <tt>c:\dm\samples\tutorial</tt>). The <tt>samples\tutorial</tt> 
directory contains a subdirectory corresponding to each lesson 
(these subdirectories are named <tt>lesson1</tt>, <tt>lesson2</tt>, <tt>lesson3</tt>, 
<tt>lesson4</tt>, and <tt>lesson5</tt>). 
<p>


Each lesson's subdirectory (except <tt>lesson2</tt>) contains three 
subdirectories, named <tt>start</tt>, <tt>finish</tt>, and <tt>backup</tt>. 

<ul>
	<li> The <tt>start</tt> subdirectory is your working directory 
	during the tutorial; it contains the project and source 
	code that you change as part of the lesson. 

	<li> The <tt>finish</tt> subdirectory contains the project as it 
	should appear after the steps in the lesson are performed 
	correctly. 

	<li> The <tt>backup</tt> subdirectory is a copy of the initial contents 
	of the <tt>start</tt> subdirectory. If you want to redo the 
	lesson from scratch, delete the contents of the <tt>start</tt> 
	subdirectory and copy all the files in the <tt>backup</tt> 
	subdirectory to the <tt>start</tt> subdirectory. 
</ul>

The subdirectory for Lesson 2 contains only a <tt>finish</tt> subdirectory. 
The <tt>start</tt> subdirectory is created as part of the lesson. 
<p>


The source and executable of the final DOS version of the TML 
Reader is contained in <tt>tutorial\tmldos</tt>. The source and 
executable of the final Windows version is located in 
<tt>tutorial\tmlread</tt>.
