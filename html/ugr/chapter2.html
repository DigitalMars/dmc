<h1>2. Introducing the IDDE</h1>

The IDDE is the Integrated Development and Debugging Environment.
The IDDE comes with the
<a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/shop.html">CD</a>
version of the development system.
This chapter introduces the Digital Mars C++ development system. The
first part of the chapter describes the IDDE main window and
toolboxes. The second part introduces Part Two of this manual, and
outlines the steps involved in developing an application in the 
IDDE. 

<h2>Running Digital Mars C++ under Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT</h2>

Digital Mars C++ ships with three different integrated development and 
debugging environments (IDDEs), each tailored to a specific 
operating system and target.
All IDDEs share 
the same user interface, and can build applications for DOS, 
Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT, and DOSX. Minor 
differences between the three IDDEs are noted throughout this 
manual, as appropriate. Not every IDDE can debug every kind of 
executable. To debug a Windows NT program, for example, you 
need the full 32-bit IDDE running under Windows NT. 
<p>

Screen images in this manual may vary in appearance from one
operating system to another.


<h3>Starting and exiting the IDDEs</h3>

To start the IDDE from the Program Manager, make sure that 
Digital Mars C++ is installed properly, then double-click on the 
appropriate IDDE icon in the Digital Mars C++ program 
group. The IDDE main window opens at the top of the screen. 
<p>

To exit the IDDE, choose one of three commands from the IDDE 
<b>File</b> menu: <b>Exit</b>, <b>Exit &amp; Save All</b>, or <b>Exit &amp; Discard</b>. <b>Exit</b> leaves the 
IDDE and returns to the Program Manager. <b>Exit &amp; Save All</b> exits and 
saves all the changes to the current project and options. <b>Exit</b> &amp; 
Discard exits the IDDE without saving any changes to the current 
project or options. 


<h2>IDDE Windows and Toolboxes</h2>

You can create, edit, and debug an application within the
IDDE. The IDDE provides a variety of tools for use throughout the 
development process. 
<p>

Unlike most Windows applications, the IDDE offers more than a 
single window in which to work. The IDDE is a feature-rich 
environment in which you work with multiple windows and 
toolboxes on the desktop. This section describes the general 
characteristics of those windows and toolboxes. 


<h3>IDDE main window</h3>

The IDDE main window, shown in Figure 2-1, is positioned at the 
top of the desktop (workspace), which is the entire screen area. 
From the IDDE main window, open other windows on the 
desktop, load projects, set project options, and perform additional 
tasks. Most of the actual work, such as editing program code, is done 
in other windows on the desktop. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" alt="Figure 2-1 IDDE main window" src="figure2_1.gif">
	[Figure 2-1 IDDE main window]
</pre>

As shown in Figure 2-1, the IDDE main window has the following 
parts: system menu, title/status bar, main menu bar, and the 
minimize button. (Also shown is the Workspace toolbox docked 
below the main window. Docking means that the toolbox is attached 
to the IDDE main window, or the desktop edge.) The system menu 
and the minimize button are the standard Windows user interface 
elements. The other elements of the main window as well as the 
IDDE toolboxes are described in the following sections. 


<h3>The title/status bar</h3>

The top line of the IDDE main window serves as both a title bar and 
a status bar. When you start the IDDE, the title bar displays the 
program name, Digital Mars C++. As actions occur in the IDDE, the title 
bar changes to a status bar and displays the status of the session, 
including the following information: 


<ul>
	<li> The command description when a menu item is 
	highlighted 

	<li> The current project that is loaded, and whether the IDDE 
	is in debugging mode 

	<li> Various messages, the results of expressions, and other 
	status information from the IDDE 
</ul>

<h3>The menu bar</h3>

The IDDE main window menu bar is located below the title bar. 
Table 2-1 summarizes the functions of the IDDE menus. 
<p>
	Table 2-1 The IDDE menu functions 
<p>
	<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0>
	<tr>
	<th>Menu	<th>Function 
	<tr>
	<td>File	<td>Opening and closing text files, exiting the IDDE 
	<tr>

	<tr>
	<td>Help	<td>Accessing online help 
	</table>
	<p>

For information on how to choose menu commands, see your 
Windows, Windows 95, or Windows NT documentation. 


<h3>The IDDE toolboxes</h3>

The IDDE includes the following four toolboxes: 

<ul>
	<li> Views 
	<li> Build 
	<li> Debug 
	<li> Workspace 
</ul>

Open a toolbox through the IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu. If the toolbox's 
name is checked, it appears in the workspace. If the name is not 
checked, select it to open the toolbox. The following sections 
describe the toolboxes in detail. 


<h4>The Views toolbox</h4>

The Views toolbox, shown in Figure 2-2, is used to open the IDDE 
windows. Each of the IDDE windows is represented by an icon in 
the toolbox. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_2.gif">
	[Figure 2-2 Views toolbox]
</pre>

To open a window from the Views toolbox, click and drag the 
appropriate icon from the toolbox onto the desktop. Alternatively, 
double-click on the icon to open the window. To replace one 
window on the screen with another, drag the icon of the window 
you want into a window on the desktop. Table 2-2 lists the IDDE 
windows. 

<p>

</table>
<p>

You can open multiple Data and Source windows. When you have 
more than one Data or Source window open, and then minimize 
more than one of them, the IDDE adds a pop-up menu to the Data 
or Source icons in the Views toolbox (see Figure 2-3). 
A small triangle in the lower-right corner of the icon indicates that a 
Source or Data window is minimized. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_3.gif">
	[Figure 2-3 Pop-up menu in Source icon]
</pre>

To open a minimized Data or Source window: 

<ol>
	<li> Move the cursor over the triangle in the lower-right 
	corner of the Data or Source window icon. 

	<li> Click to open the pop-up menu. 

	<li> Choose the window title you want from the pop-up 
	menu. That window becomes active. 
</ol>

Alternatively, move the cursor over the window title in the pop-up 
menu, then click and hold the mouse button. A window icon 
appears to the right (see Figure 2-3). Drag the cursor over the icon, 
then move the cursor over either the desktop or an open window 
and release the mouse button. 


<h4>The Build toolbox</h4>

The Build toolbox, shown in Figure 2-4, provides quick access to 
project build commands. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_4.gif">
	[Figure 2-4 Build toolbox]
</pre>

To use the Build toolbox, click on the appropriate button in the 
toolbox. These buttons perform the following tasks: 

<ul>
	<li> Compile a single source file 
	<li> Build the project 
	<li> Rebuild the entire project 
	<li> Stop the build in progress 
</ul>

<h4>The Debug toolbox</h4>

Debug toolbox icons (shown in Figure 2-5) let you efficiently choose 
debugging commands during a debugging session. The commands 
available in the Debug toolbox correspond to the commands on the 
IDDE <b>Debug</b> menu and are described in detail in the section "Debug 
Toolbox Icons," in
<a href="chapter23.html">Controlling and Configuring the Debugger</a>. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_5.gif">
	[Figure 2-5 Debug toolbox]
</pre>

<h4>The Workspace toolbox</h4>
 
When you first open the IDDE, the Workspace toolbox appears 
docked below the IDDE main window menu bar. The Workspace 
toolbox is used for switching between workspaces, which are 
customized layouts of windows that you define. The Workspace 
toolbox is shown in Figure 2-6. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_6.gif">
	[Figure 2-6 Workspace toolbox]
</pre>

As you create new workspaces, their names appear on tabs in the 
Workspace toolbox. To switch to a different workspace, click on its 
tab. For more information on defining workspaces, see
<a href="chapter3.html">Starting a Project and Defining Workspaces</a>. 


<h4>Using toolboxes</h4>

The IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu lists the names of all toolboxes. When a 
checkmark is displayed next to the toolbox name, the toolbox 
appears in the current workspace. To open a toolbox, select the 
toolbox name from the IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu. 
<p>

You can position a toolbox on the desktop by clicking on its title bar 
and dragging the toolbox to the desired position on the screen. To 
dock a toolbox, position it on the IDDE main window or on the 
edge of the screen. To undock the toolbox, click on the toolbox and 
drag it away from the IDDE main window or the desktop edge. 
<p>

You can change the shape of a toolbox by clicking the toolbox edge 
and dragging the outline of the toolbox to the desired shape. 
<p>

If you want to remove an icon from a toolbox, right-click on the icon 
you want to remove, drag it from the toolbox, and drop it. 
<p>

Toolboxes can be configured with commands in their pop-up 
menus. To access a toolbox's pop-up menu, right-click on an empty 
part of the toolbox (as shown in Figure 2-7). When the first menu 
item, <b>Dockable</b>, is checked, you can dock the toolbox. The next 
three items (<b>Small</b>, <b>Medium</b>, and <b>Large</b>) let you change the size of 
the toolbox and its icons. The last item on the menu, <b>Reset Palette</b>, 
lets you restore any icons or buttons you have removed from the 
toolbox. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_7.gif">
	[Figure 2-7 toolbox pop-up menu]
</pre>

To identify a toolbox icon, hold the mouse cursor over the icon for a 
few seconds. A small yellow tag appears, showing the name of the 
icon. 


To close a toolbox, click on the Close box. Each 
toolbox has a Close box in the upper-right corner, as shown in 
Figure 2-8. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_8.gif">
	[Figure 2-8 Close box]
</pre>

<h3>The IDDE windows</h3>

This section describes the general properties of the IDDE windows 
and how to work with them. 

<h4>Opening and closing windows in the IDDE</h4>

Digital Mars C++ supports both standard Windows methods and a few 
unique methods for displaying and managing windows. In the IDDE, 
open a window in any of the following ways: 

<ul>
	<li> From the Views toolbox. 

	<li> Through the <b>Goto View</b> submenu of the IDDE's 
	<b>Window</b> menu. The <b>Goto View</b> submenu lists all of the 
	windows you can open, along with the shortcut keys that 
	open those windows. 

	<li> By choosing <b>Window List</b> from the IDDE's <b>Window</b>
	menu or from the system menu of any IDDE window. A 
	dialog box listing all IDDE windows opens. Choose a 
	window name from the list and click OK. 
</ul>

When you open a Source window to edit a specific source file, the 
filename is added to the <b>Window List</b> dialog box. You can then 
activate this particular window from the <b>Window List</b> dialog box. 
<p>

Each window has a Close box similar to that of a toolbox (see 
Figure 2-8). Click on the box to close the window. 

<h4>Using the drag-and-drop feature</h4>

The Digital Mars C++ IDDE provides a drag-and-drop feature that lets 
you execute commands by dragging from one window onto another 
or onto the desktop. For example, you can drag a module's name 
from the project window onto the desktop in order to edit that 
module in a Source window. When something cannot be dropped 
on a particular window or the desktop, the cursor changes from that 
icon to a "No" sign (a circle with a diagonal line through it). Most of 
the drag-and-drop functionality is available in debugging mode and 
is described in
<a href="chapter24">Commands Available in Debugging Mode</a>. 


<h2>Using the IDDE</h2>

The following sections serve as an overview of Part Two of this 
manual and introduce you to the process involved with creating an 
application in the Digital Mars C++ environment. 


<h3>Creating a project</h3>

Projects are integral to the Digital Mars C++ development system. You 
cannot build an application without creating a project. A project is a 
collection of source files, headers, resource files, and other 
components that you need to build an application. 
<p>

To help you create a new project, a new tool called ProjectExpress is 
included. This tool lets you select the project target (the result of 
your development efforts), the directory for the project files, and 
other options. While in ProjectExpress, you can also use AppExpress 
to generate the framework for the application. 
<p>

AppExpress is a tool that automatically generates an application 
framework. AppExpress lets you select from a variety of application 
types, then creates a working skeleton of source code and resource 
definitions. After the framework is generated, then concentrate 
on customizing the framework and implementing the features of 
the application. 


<h3>Using workspaces</h3>

Because the IDDE provides a variety of windows used for 
specialized tasks, you probably do not need all of them open 
simultaneously. The IDDE workspaces provide a convenient way to 
switch from one screen layout to another. Workspaces are task-oriented, 
as opposed to project-oriented. You create workspaces for 
different tasks, such as editing, browsing, or debugging, which you 
perform in different projects. The <b>Workspace</b> submenu of the 
IDDE's <b>Environment</b> menu provides access to workspace 
commands. 


<h3>Creating and editing your application</h3>

Once you have created a project, you can start working on the 
program's code. This section introduces the IDDE tools. 

<h4>Creating and editing resources</h4> 

If writing a Windows application, you probably need to 
create resources such as menus and dialog boxes. Commands on the 
IDDE's <b>Resource</b> menu access the Digital Mars C++ ResourceStudio, a 
powerful tool for creating and editing resources. 


<h4>Binding resources to classes</h4> 

ClassExpress is a tool for binding resources, such as dialog box 
controls, to the classes in the program. This is needed in order 
to be able to respond to user actions. Launch ClassExpress 
by choosing <b>ClassExpress</b> from the IDDE's <b>Tools</b> menu, or from 
within ResourceStudio. 


<h4>Editing class hierarchies</h4> 

The IDDE provides two tools for editing class hierarchies: Class 
Editor and Hierarchy Editor. Open a Class or Hierarchy 
Editor window from the Views toolbox, or from the <b>Goto View</b> 
submenu of the IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu. Both editors have the same 
functionality, but different interfaces. The Class Editor emphasizes 
member editing, while the Hierarchy Editor emphasizes inheritance 
relationships. 

<h4>Editing code</h4> 

While you can greatly reduce the amount of work needed to write a 
complex application using the tools Digital Mars C++ provides, 
eventually you need to edit the raw source code. The IDDE includes 
a powerful, scriptable text editor with features such as customizable 
key bindings, automatic token coloring, delimiter matching, and 
other features. Edit code in the Source window, which can be 
opened from the Views toolbox or the <b>Goto View</b> submenu of the 
IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu. 


<h3>Debugging your application</h3>

After writing most or all of the application's source code, it is time 
to test and debug it. Do this by switching the IDDE into 
debugging mode and using the commands on the IDDE's Debug 
menu, the Debug toolbox, and various debugging windows
opened from the Views toolbox. 


<h3>Using help</h3>

The following sections describe several ways to get online help in 
the IDDE. 

<h4>The title/status bar</h4> 

When you click and hold on a command in a menu, the IDDE main 
window title/status bar shows a brief description of the menu 
command. 


<h4>The IDDE Help menu</h4> 

The IDDE provides several online help systems through the IDDE 
<b>Help</b> menu. The first items on the <b>IDDE</b> Help menu access the 
IDDE Help system, shown in Figure 2-9. To navigate the IDDE Help 
system, click on the icon representing the type of help needed. 
<p>

Alternatively, choose <b>Search</b> from the IDDE <b>Help</b> menu to find a 
particular topic in the IDDE Help system. 

<pre>
	<img align="middle" src="figure2_9.gif">
	[Figure 2-9 IDDE Help system]
</pre>

Other commands on the Help menu access Windows API and 
Microsoft Foundation Class reference material. 
<p>

Finally, the <b>About Digital Mars C++</b> command on the IDDE <b>Help</b> 
menu displays a dialog box with version information on the 
Digital Mars C++ Development System. 


<h4>Other ways to launch online help</h4>

To view help information for a run-time library 
function, highlight the name of the function in a Text Editor 
window and type CTRL+ALT+F1. 
<p>

To view frequently used help topics without navigating 
IDDE Help, associate specific .hlp files with key combinations. 
(For example, to view help for ResourceStudio, map 
<tt>rstudio.hlp</tt> with the key combination CTRL+ALT+F4.) 
<p>

To associate a key combination with a help file, choose <b>Edit/Browsing
Settings</b> from the IDDE's <b>Environment</b> menu. Click 
Text, then click Help files.
