<h1>21. Text Editor Reference</h1>


This chapter describes commands and options available in the text 
editor, including global search functions, key binding options, and 
macro functions. For an introduction to text editing, see Chapter 6, 
<a href="chapter6.html">Editing Program Code</a>.

<ul>
	<li><a href="#sourcewindow"><b>The Source Window</b></a>
	<li><a href="#textsettings"><b>Text Settings</b></a>
	<li><a href="#globalfind"><b>Using Global Find</b></a>
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="sourcewindow"><h2>The Source Window</h2></a>

To open a Source window, you have several choices: 

<ul>
	<li> Choose <b>New</b> or <b>Open</b> from the IDDE's <b>File</b> menu. 

	<li> Choose <b>Source</b> from the <b>Goto View</b> submenu of the 
	IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu. 

	<li> Double-click on the Source icon in the Views toolbox, or 
	drag the icon from the toolbox to the desktop. 

	<li> Double-click on a filename in the Project window. 

	<li> Choose <b>Show Source</b> or <b>Show Header</b> from pop-up 
	menus in the Class and Hierarchy Editors. 

	<li> Double-click on an error message in the Error window. 

	<li> Choose <b>New</b> or <b>Open</b> from another Source window's 
	<b>File</b> menu. 

	<li> Choose <b>New!</b> from another Source window's menu bar. 

	<li> Select text in one Source view, then drag it onto the 
	desktop. This results in an untitled Source window 
	containing the selected text. 
</ul>


The Hierarchy Editor's Source child window, as well as the Source 
pane of the Class Editor, contain a subset of the standard Source 
window functionality. See Chapter 5,
<a href="chapter5.html">Defining Classes and Their Hierarchies</a>,
 Chapter 19,
<a href="chapter19.html">Class Editor Reference</a>,
 and Chapter 20, 
<a href="chapter20.html">Hierarchy Editor Reference</a>.


<h3>File menu commands</h3>

The <b>File</b> menu (Figure 21-1) contains commands to open, save, and 
print files, as well as other useful file-related commands. Note that 
the <b>Save and Add to Project</b> command changes to <b>Add to Project</b>, 
<b>Save and Parse</b>, or <b>Parse</b>, depending on whether the file is part of 
the project, up to date, or parsed. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-1 File menu commands 

<h4>New</h4>
Opens a new, empty, and untitled Source window. 

<h4>Open</h4>
Opens a Windows <b>File Open</b> dialog box, then creates a new Source 
window containing the selected file. If the <b>Open</b> command is 
chosen from an untitled, unmodified Source window, the selected 
file is opened in that Source window. 

<h4>Load</h4>
Opens a Windows <b>File Open</b> dialog box, then loads the selected file 
into the current Source window. If there are unsaved changes in the 
previous file, you are asked if you would like to save the changes 
before loading the new file. 

<h4>Close</h4>
Closes the Source window. If there are unsaved changes, you are 
asked if you would like to save the changes before closing the file. 

<h4>Save</h4>
Saves the current buffer to disk. If the file is untitled, this command 
executes <b>Save As</b>. 

<h4>Save as</h4>
Saves the current buffer using the Windows <b>File Save As</b> dialog box. 
This dialog box contains a check box— Add to Project, which lets 
you add the file to the current project. 

<h4>Save All</h4>
Executes <b>Save</b> for every open Source window. 

<h4>Compile</h4>
Saves the buffer and compiles the file. 


<h4>Save and Add to Project</h4>
Saves the file to disk, adds the file to the project, and reparses all 
files in the project. 
<p>

The Save and Add to Project command changes to Add to Project, 
Save and Parse, or Parse, depending on whether the file is part of 
the project, up to date, or parsed. These are the four changes: 

<ol>
	<li> A new source file is created but not saved, or flagged as 
	modified since the last save. The menu reads "Save and 
	Add to Project." 

	<li> A source file which has not been added to the project is 
	saved. The menu reads "Add to Project." 

	<li> A source file which exists in a project is loaded in the 
	source editor. The menu reads "Parse." 

	<li> A source file exists in a project and has been flagged or 
	modified. The menu read "Save and Parse." 
</ol>


<h4>Add to Project</h4>
Adds the file to the project and reparses all files in the project. 

<h4>Save and Parse</h4>
Saves the file to disk and reparses all files in the project. 

<h4>Parse</h4>
Reparses all files in the project. 


<h4>Compare</h4>
Opens the <b>Compare Files</b> dialog box (Figure 21-2), which lets you 
select two files to compare. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-2 Compare Files dialog box 

<h5>File 1 and File 2</h5>
Specifies the files to be compared. You may type the file names, 
select names from the drop-down lists, or click on Browse to select 
files from standard Windows filename dialog boxes. 
<p>


If either file is open in a Source window, the editor uses the version 
in memory rather than the one in the disk file. 


<h5>Line</h5>
Specifies the line number at which the comparison starts. 


<h5>Display</h5>
Specifies the arrangement of the windows in which the two files are 
displayed: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Horizontal:</b> <dd>The files are displayed one above the other. 

<dt><b>Vertical:</b> <dd>The files are displayed side-by-side. 


The editor performs the comparison on a line-by-line basis. When it 
finds a mismatch, it highlights the appropriate lines in both files. The 
<b>Compare</b> dialog box (Figure 21-3) indicates where the mismatch 
was found. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-3 Compare dialog box showing mismatch 


<dt><b>Next match:</b> <dd>Click on this button to resynchronize the 
comparison. The editor highlights the next set of matching lines 
and the <b>Compare</b> dialog box indicates where the match occurs. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-4 Compare dialog box showing match 

<dt><b>Next difference:</b> <dd>Click on this button to find the next mismatched 
line. You can continue the comparison in this way until no more 
differences are found. 
</dl>


<h4>Insert</h4>
Opens an <b>Insert File</b> dialog box. The editor inserts the contents of 
the file you select at the current insertion point. 

<h4>Revert</h4>
Rereads the file from disk, abandoning any changes made since the 
last time it was saved. 

<h4>Page Setup</h4>
Opens the <b>Page Setup</b> dialog box (Figure 21-5), which sets 
parameters for printing. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_5.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-5 Page Setup dialog box 

<h5>Header and footer</h5>

The header and footer are single lines of text displayed at the top 
and bottom (respectively) of each page of the printed output. To 
omit the header or footer, leave the textbox empty. 
<p>


You can embed the following special-purpose codes in the header 
and footer text: 

<ul>
	<li> <b><tt>%f</tt></b> gives the full path and filename of active file 
	<li> <b><tt>%d</tt></b> gives the current date and time 
	<li> <b><tt>%p</tt></b> gives the current page number 
</ul>


<h5>Margins</h5>
Sets the page margins. The units are the standard units of 
measurement used in your country (inches or centimeters), set in the 
Windows Control Panel. 


<h5>Font</h5>
Opens a Windows <b>Font</b> dialog box, with which you select a 
typeface, style, and size for the printed output. The entire document, 
including headers and footers, is shown in the selected font. 


<h5>Printer</h5>
Opens a Windows <b>Print Setup</b> dialog box, with which you can set 
additional printing parameters. 


<h4>Print</h4>
Opens the <b>Text Print</b> dialog box (Figure 21-6), to let you set 
additional print options and print the current file or text selection. 
After setting print options, click OK to print. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-6 Text Print dialog box 

<h5>Print range</h5>
Specifies whether the entire file or just the current text selection is 
printed: 

<dl>
<dt><b>All:</b> <dd>Prints the entire file. 

<dt><b>Selection:</b> <dd>Prints the highlighted text selection. (It is disabled if no 
text is selected.) 
</dl>


<h5>Print quality</h5>
This drop-down listbox specifies print quality. Options include the 
specified printer's output capabilities, expressed in dots per inch. 


<h5>Copies</h5>
Specifies the number of copies to print. 


<h5>Setup</h5>
Opens a Windows <b>Print Setup</b> dialog box, with which you can set 
additional printing parameters. 


<h3>Edit menu commands</h3>

The <b>Edit</b> menu (Figure 21-7) contains standard edit and search 
commands, as well as commands to access text editor options. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-7 Edit menu commands 

<h4>Undo</h4>
Reverses the last cut, paste, replace, or typed character. By 
repeatedly choosing this command, you can undo previous 
commands, up to the limit of the undo buffer. 

<h4>Cut</h4>
Copies the selected text to the Clipboard, then deletes it from the 
buffer. 

<h4>Copy</h4>
Copies the selected text to the Clipboard. 

<h4>Paste</h4>
Inserts the text from the Clipboard at the insertion point. 

<h4>Delete</h4>
Deletes the selected text from the buffer. 

<h4>Find</h4>
Opens the <b>Find</b> dialog box (Figure 21-8), used to search the file for 
specified text. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_10.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-8 Find dialog box 

<h5>Pattern</h5>
This drop-down listbox contains the text to be found. 
<p>


You can initialize the pattern by selecting the text before choosing 
<b>Find</b>. (The text must not span a line break.) Otherwise, you may 
type the text you want to find into the textbox, or select text from 
previous search strings, stored in the drop-down listbox. 
<p>


The pattern may also be a regular expression (text containing 
wildcard characters) if the Regular Expression option is selected. 
Regular expression syntax is discussed in "Using Global Find," later 
in this chapter. 


<h5>Ignore case</h5>
If this option is turned on, the search is not case sensitive. 


<h5>Whole words only</h5>
If this option is turned on, a string is considered a match only if it is 
not part of a larger alphanumeric string. 


<h5>Regular expression</h5>
This option enables regular expression matching. 
<p>

The search begins at the current insertion point. Click Next to search 
forward in the file, or Previous to search backward in the file. If the 
search is successful, the matching text is highlighted. Otherwise, the 
status line displays the message "Pattern not found." 


<h4>Repeat Find</h4>
Continues the search begun by <b>Find</b>. The search resumes from the 
current insertion point and proceeds in the direction previously 
specified. 
<p>

If the search is successful, the matching text is highlighted. 
Otherwise, the status line displays the message "Pattern not found." 


<h4>Find Previous</h4>
Searches backward from the current insertion point for the text to be 
found. 


<h4>Find Next</h4>
Searches forward from the current insertion point for the text to be 
found. 


<h4>Replace</h4>
Opens the <b>Replace</b> dialog box (Figure 21-9), which lets you find 
and replace occurrences of text with different text. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_11.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-9 Replace dialog box 

<h5>Pattern</h5>
This drop-down listbox contains the text to be found and replaced. 
<p>


You can initialize the pattern by selecting text before choosing 
<b>Replace</b>. (The text must not span a line break.) Otherwise, you may 
type the text you want to find into the textbox, or select text from 
previous search strings, stored in the drop-down listbox. 
<p>


The pattern may also be a regular expression (text containing 
wildcard characters) if the Regular Expressions option is selected. 
Regular expression syntax is discussed in the section "Using Global 
Find," later in this chapter. 


<h5>Replacement</h5>
This drop-down listbox contains the text with which you replace 
occurrences of Pattern. Type the replacement text into the textbox, 
or select text from previous replacement strings, stored in the drop-down 
listbox. 


<h5>Ignore case</h5>
If this option is turned on, the search is not case sensitive. 


<h5>Regular expressions</h5>
Enables regular expression matching. 


<h5>Confirm changes</h5>
Causes the text editor to request confirmation before each 
replacement. If this option is not selected, the editor replaces all 
occurrences of Pattern, starting at the current insertion point, without 
prompting you. 


<h5>Restrict changes to selected text</h5>
Instructs the text editor to perform replacements only within the 
selected block of text. 


<h5>Whole words only</h5>
If selected, the text editor considers text a match only if it is not part 
of a larger alphanumeric string. 
<p>


The search/replace operation begins at the current insertion point. If 
you have selected Confirm Changes, the <b>Confirm Replacement</b> 
dialog box (Figure 21-10) is displayed when a match is found. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_12.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-10 Confirm Replacement dialog box 
	<p>

You may click Yes to make the replacement, No to skip this 
replacement, or Cancel to end the search/replace operation. Also, if 
you uncheck Confirm, then click Yes, the editor replaces all 
remaining occurrences of Pattern without prompting you. 


<h4>Global Find</h4>
Opens the <b>Global Find</b> dialog box. See "Using Global Find," later in 
this chapter. 


<h4>Current Buffer Settings</h4>
Opens the <b>Current Buffer Options</b> dialog box (Figure 21-11), with 
which you can change editing options for the current Source 
window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_15.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-11 Current Buffer Options dialog box 

<h5>Tab spacing</h5>
Specifies the number of columns between tab stops. 


<h5>Right margin</h5>
Specifies the column that acts as the right margin. 


<h5>Word wrap</h5>
Enables word wrap. While typing, lines extending beyond the right 
margin are broken automatically at the last word boundary before 
the margin. 


<h5>Autoindent</h5>
Enables automatic indentation on newline. When you press Enter, 
the editor positions the cursor directly below the first nonblank 
character in the previous line. 


<h5>Read only</h5>
Sets the read-only flag on the buffer, so the buffer may not be 
changed. 


<h5>Use as default for ...</h5>
Saves the Current Buffer Options settings so they become the 
defaults for any subsequent file with the same file extension that is 
loaded. For example, if the file that is currently open is "test. cpp," 
the check box reads, "Use as default for .cpp." If this is an untitled 
buffer, the check box is disabled. 


<h5>Expand tabs with spaces</h5>
Tabs are inserted into the text as an appropriate number of spaces 
rather than as tab characters. 


<h5>C++ mode</h5>
The buffer is treated as C++ code. Special options for C++ code are 
set in the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box. 


<h5>Persistent</h5>
Causes the buffer options for this file to be saved during the current 
IDDE session, even if the file is closed. Otherwise, buffer options are 
set to their global defaults if a file is closed and reopened. 


<h4>Text Setting</h4>
Opens the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box, in which you set 
global text editing options. Details of this dialog box are discussed in 
the "Text Settings" section later in this chapter. 


<h3>Goto menu commands</h3>

The <b>Goto</b> menu (Figure 21-12) contains commands to move within 
the source file.

	<p>
	[Figure 21-12 Goto menu commands 

<h4>Line</h4>
Opens the <b>Goto Line</b> dialog box (Figure 21-13). Type the line 
number and click OK, and the insertion point is moved to the 
specified line. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_5.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-13 Goto Line dialog box 


<h4>Function</h4>
Opens the <b>Goto Function</b> dialog box (Figure 21-14). 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-14 Goto Function dialog box 
	<p>

The Function Name listbox holds the available function names. 
Either type in the function name or scroll and select the function 
name from the list. When you click OK, the insertion point moves to 
the beginning of the specified function. 
<p>


Member functions in the list typically are displayed as 
<i>member</i>::<i>class</i>. To change the format to <i>class</i>::<i>member</i>, deselect 
the Reverse Class::Member Format option. 


<h4>Matching Delimiter</h4>
Finds the delimiter that matches the one to the right of the current 
insertion point. The insertion point is moved to the front of the 
matching delimiter. This command can find matching parentheses, 
square brackets, or braces. 


<h4>Bookmark</h4>
Opens the <b>Bookmarks</b> dialog box (Figure 21-15), which you can 
use to set and move to as many as ten different locations in your 
source files. Bookmarks are saved through the current IDDE session 
only. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-15 Bookmarks dialog box 


<h5>Bookmark list</h5>
Shows the locations of the ten bookmarks by file, line, and column. 
Click on an entry to select it; double-click on an entry to go to it. 


<h5>Goto</h5>
Moves the insertion point to the selected bookmark. This command 
opens a file if it is not already open. You can also double-click on 
the bookmark in the list. 


<h5>Clear</h5>
Removes the selected bookmark. 


<h5>Drop</h5>
Sets the selected bookmark to the current insertion point. The entry 
in the bookmark list is updated to show the file, line, and column. 


<h4>Buffer</h4>
Opens the <b>Edit Buffers</b> dialog box (Figure 21-16). This dialog box 
presents a list of files currently open in Source windows; it allows 
you to view and change each buffer's editing options and to perform 
various file-related operations. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_16.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-16 Edit Buffers dialog box 

<h5>Context</h5>
This drop-down listbox specifies File Buffers or Member Buffers. File 
Buffers are Source windows open to edit an entire file. Member 
Buffers are Class Editor Source panes and Hierarchy Editor Source 
child windows, open to edit a particular member definition. 


<h5>Buffer list</h5>
Contains the names of files currently open in Source windows (or, if 
the Member Buffers context is selected, the names of member 
functions open in Class Editor Source panes and Hierarchy Editor 
Source child windows). Click on a filename to select it; double-click 
on it to bring the corresponding Source window to the front. 


<h5>Buffer properties</h5>
Lets you view and set options for each individual buffer listed in the 
buffer list. 


<dl>
<dt><b>Tab spacing:</b> <dd>Specifies the number of columns between tab stops. 

<dt><b>Right margin:</b> <dd>Specifies the column that acts as the right margin. 

<dt><b>Word wrap:</b> <dd>Enables word wrap. While typing, lines that extend 
beyond the right margin are broken automatically at the last word 
boundary before the margin. 

<dt><b>Autoindent:</b> <dd>Causes the text editor to indent automatically on 
newline. When you press Enter, the editor positions the cursor 
directly below the first nonblank character in the previous line. 

<dt><b>Read only:</b> <dd>The buffer may not be changed. 

<dt><b>Use as default for ...:</b> <dd>Saves the Current Buffer Options settings as 
the defaults for any subsequent file with the same file extension that 
is loaded. For example, if the currently open file is <tt>test.cpp</tt>, the 
check box reads, "Use as default for .cpp." If the currently open file

<hr>
<a name="textsettings"><h2>Text Settings</h2></a>

Choosing <b>Text Settings</b> from the Source window's <b>Edit</b> menu opens 
the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box, a workspace with tabs 
along the top margin. The tabs are used to switch between several 
sets of options. Each set of options is described below. 


<a name="generaloptions"><h3>General options</h3></a>

The General options set (Figure 21-25) contains options for undo 
levels and the key binding file, as well as some options related to the 
Class and Hierarchy Editors. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_25.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-25 General options 

<h4>Browser operations</h4>
Specifies the number of operations that can be undone in the Class 
and Hierarchy Editors. See Chapter 19,
<a href="chapter19.html">Class Editor Reference</a>,
 and Chapter 20,
<a href="chapter20.html">Hierarchy Editor Reference</a>.


<h4>Text edits, per buffer</h4>
Specifies the number of edit operations that can be undone per 
buffer. 


<h4>Confirmations</h4>
Enables confirmation requests for various operations in the Class and 
Hierarchy Editors. See Chapter 19,
<a href="chapter19.html">Class Editor Reference</a>,
 and Chapter 20,
<a href="chapter20.html">Hierarchy Editor Reference</a>.


<h4>Open output window on message</h4>
Lets the IDDE open an error window whenever there is an error of 
any kind (during compilation, during parsing, and so on.) 


<h4>Keyboard emulation file</h4>
Specifies the key bindings set to be used. Key bindings allow you to 
associate keystroke sequences with functions and macros. 
Information about key bindings sets can be found in the Digital Mars 
C++ IDDE Help. 


<h4>Multiple selections</h4>
Enables multiple selections in lists in the Class and Hierarchy editors. 
See Chapter 19,
<a href="chapter19.html">Class Editor Reference</a>,
 and Chapter 20,
<a href="chapter20.html">Hierarchy Editor Reference</a>.


<h3>Text options</h3>

The Text options set (Figure 21-26) contains options for indentation, 
cursor styles, keyboard emulation, and text editor font. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_14.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-26 Text options 

<h4>Tab spacing</h4>
Specifies the default for the number of columns between tab stops. 
This value may be overridden locally in each buffer. 


<h4>Right margin</h4>
Specifies the default for the column that acts as the right margin. This 
value may be overridden locally in each buffer. 


<h4>Autoindent</h4>
Indents automatically on newline. When you press Enter, the editor 
positions the cursor directly below the first nonblank character in the 
previous line. This option may be overridden locally in each buffer. 


<h4>Expand tabs with spaces</h4>
Tabs are inserted into the text as an appropriate number of spaces, 
rather than as tab characters. This option may be overridden locally 
in each buffer. 


<h4>Show horizontal scroll bar</h4>
Enables the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the Source 
window. 


<h4>Remove trailing spaces on save</h4>
Trailing spaces and Tabs are removed from the end of each line 
when a file is saved. 


<h4>Cursor styles</h4>
Specifies caret style. You may set styles individually for the caret in 
Insert and Overwrite modes. Styles are: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Block:</b> <dd>The current character is displayed in inverse video. 
<dt><b>Underline:</b> <dd>The current character is underlined. 
<dt><b>Vertical bar:</b> <dd>A vertical bar appears to the left of the current 
character. 
<dt><b>Blink:</b> <dd>The cursor blinks. The blink rate is specified in the Windows 
Control Panel. 
</dl>


<h4>Font</h4>
Specifies the text font. You can select a predefined font from the 
drop-down list, or you can click Custom and select any installed font 
from a Windows <b>Font</b> dialog box.


<h4>Brief-compatible select</h4>
If you choose this option, then enter the "Toggle Mode Select" 
mode. The editor remains in selection mode when you use the 
arrow keys. 


<h4>Typing replaces selection</h4>
Enables the Windows standard convention of replacing selected text 
with any typed character or pasted text. If this option is not selected, 
typing or pasting inserts the text to the left of the current selection. 


<h4>Cut/copy line without selection</h4>
If no text is selected, <b>Cut</b> and <b>Copy</b>, respectively, cut and copy the 
current line. If text is selected, <b>Cut</b> and <b>Copy</b> work as usual. 
<p>

If this option is not selected, <b>Cut</b> and <b>Copy</b> have no effect if no text 
is selected. 


<h4>Normal selection for debugging</h4>
Enables normal selection of text when in debugging mode. If 
disabled, you can drag from the source window to the Assembly, 
Data/Object, and Function windows while debugging. 


<h4>Virtual cursor</h4>
Enables virtual cursor mode, in which you can position the caret 
anywhere in the window, regardless of line endings. Note that even 
with this option enabled, you still cannot position the caret beyond 
the last line in the file. 


<h4>Enable menu accelerators</h4>
Enables menu accelerator keys. With this option selected, new 
windows have underscores beneath the top-level menu items to 
show the Alt key combination you can use to access the menu. 


<h4>Help Files</h4>
Clicking on Help Files opens the Text Help File Configuration dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 21-27. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_27.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-27 Text Help File Configuration dialog box 
	<p>

This dialog box lets you associate particular Windows Help files with 
each of the four Text Help commands. The Text Help commands are 
run by key sequences such as Shift+F1. (The exact mapping of key 
sequences to Text Help commands depends on the current key 
mapping. See "Keys options," later in this chapter.) The Text Help 
commands call the Windows API function Windows Help, passing it 
the name of a Windows Help file and (optionally) a keyword. The 
Text Help commands are useful, for example, for gaining access to 
help on a particular API function or MFC class directly from the 
source code. 

<dl>
<dt><b>Text Help Command:</b> <dd>Specifies a Text Help command (TextHelp1, 
TextHelp2, TextHelp3, TextHelp4). 

<dt><b>Help File:</b> <dd>Specifies the Windows Help file to be associated with the 
selected Text Help command. This filename is passed to Windows 
Help when the Text Help command is run. 

<dt><b>Grab Token At Insertion Point:</b> <dd>If this box is checked, the Text 
Help commands pass the token at the insertion point in the text 
buffer to Windows Help as a keyword. This causes Windows Help to 
search for the associated topic, and, if found, to immediately display 
help on the keyword topic. 
</dl>


<h3>C++ options</h3>

The C++ options set (Figure 21-28) contains options to check 
delimiters, indent after braces, and auto-align comments. It also 
allows you to add custom keywords to the keyword dictionary. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_28.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-28 C++ options 

<h4>Check delimiters</h4>
If you type a right parenthesis, square bracket, or brace, the editor 
briefly highlights the corresponding left delimiter. If no matching 
delimiter is found, an error message is displayed. 


<h4>Enable C++ mode</h4>
This option enables C++ mode globally. If it is not selected, C++ 
mode features are disabled for all buffers, regardless of local buffer 
option settings. 


<h4>Enable C++ mode for untitled files</h4>
When this option is on, new files that have not yet been given a 
name are assumed to be C/C++ source. This box should be checked 
in most circumstances, so that keywords can be recognized in new 
files, for example. 


<h4>Indent after {</h4>
If the last character typed on a line is a left brace, the next line is 
indented automatically by an extra tab stop. This option works only 
if Autoindent is enabled in the buffer. Also, if the first character on a 
line is a right brace (}), the line is unindented automatically; this is 
independent of the Autoindent option. 


<h4>Auto-align comments at column</h4>
If this option is enabled, when you type <tt>//</tt> to start a C++ 
comment, the editor automatically indents the comment to a 
specified alignment column. You can specify the alignment column 
in the adjacent textbox. 


<h4>Enable C++ mode on extensions</h4>
Specifies the file extensions for which C++ mode is automatically 
enabled. Type the extensions into the textbox, separated by spaces. 


<h4>Custom keywords</h4>
You can maintain a set of custom keywords that are highlighted in 
the edit window in a manner you specify (see "Display options," 
later in this chapter). 
<p>

To add a new keyword, type the keyword into the textbox and click 
on Add. To remove a keyword from the list, click on the keyword in 
the list and click on Remove. 


<h3>Keys options</h3>

The Keys options set (Figure 21-29) lets you customize key bindings 
and assign key combinations to macros. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_29.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-29 Keys options
	<p>


A Key Bindings file (<tt>.key</tt>) associates keystroke sequences with 
editor commands and user-defined macros. You can select the 
particular key binding set you want to use either with the Key File 
option below, or with the Keyboard Emulation file option under the 
General tab (see <a href="#generaloptions">General options</a>,
earlier in this section). 
<p>


Commands are grouped into functional categories. The groups are: 

<dl>
	<dt><b>Global:</b> <dd>Global commands, used anywhere (includes all 
	user-defined macros) 

	<dt><b>Member:</b> <dd>Member-related commands, used in the Class 
	and Hierarchy Editors 

	<dt><b>Text:</b> <dd>Text editor functions and commands, used in 
	Source windows 

	<dt><b>Class:</b> <dd>Class-related commands, used in the Class and 
	Hierarchy Editors 

	<dt><b>Project:</b> <dd>Project-related commands, used in the Project 
	window 
</dl>


You may assign more than one keystroke sequence to a command. 
However, within a category, only one command may be associated 
with a particular keystroke sequence. 


<h4>Key file</h4>
Specifies the key bindings set to be used. Select a keyboard 
emulation file from the drop-down list. 


<h4>Keys</h4>
Specifies a key sequence. This is not an ordinary textbox; it can 
display any keystroke sequence. 
<p>


There are two ways to enter a keystroke sequence into the textbox: 

<ul>
	<li> Click in the textbox and type the keystroke sequence. 
	You can enter most sequences in this way. (Keys you 
	cannot enter directly into the box include Home, End, 
	Delete, Backspace, Right Arrow, Left Arrow, and Tab.) 

	<li> Use the Recorder buttons. Click on the green arrow to 
	start recording. Enter your keystroke sequence. Click on 
	the red box to stop recording. 
</ul>


<h4>Commands/macros</h4>
The textbox displays the currently selected command (or macro). 
You can type in the command name or select a command from the 
list by clicking on it. 
<p>


The list displays commands and associated key sequences. If more 
than one sequence is assigned to a command, it is listed as many 
times as necessary. The content and sorting of the list is determined 
by the Commands/Macros List Options. 


<h4>Commands/macros list options</h4>
Determine the filtering and sorting of commands and macros shown 
in the Commands/Macros list. 


<dl>
<dt><b>Scope:</b> <dd>Displays commands only in the specified functional category. 
Categories are Global, Member, Text, Class, and Project. Specify All 
to see all commands. 

<dt><b>Show bound keys only:</b> <dd>Shows only those commands with an 
associated keystroke sequence. 

<dt><b>Sort by command:</b> <dd>Displays the list alphabetically by command. If 
this option is not selected, the list is ordered by key sequence. 

<dt><b>Copy to clipboard:</b> <dd>Copies the current contents of the commands/
macros list to the Clipboard. 
</dl>


<h4>Assign</h4>
Assigns the keystroke sequence to the selected command. 
<p>


If another command in the same functional category is already 
bound to this keystroke sequence, you are asked if you want to 
reassign the sequence to the new command. 


<h4>Unassign</h4>
Dissociates the selected command from its keystroke sequence. 


<h4>Save as</h4>
Saves the key bindings to a new file. When prompted, type the name 
of the new file, or select a file from the drop-down list. 


<h3>Display options</h3>

The Display options set (Figure 21-30) lets you select special font 
colors and styles for keywords, comments, preprocessor symbols, 
and other special text. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_30.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-30 Display options 

<h4>Source code display</h4>

Allows you to customize syntax highlighting. You can specify the 
highlighting for: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Comments:</b> <dd>C/C++ comments 

<dt><b>Custom keywords:</b> <dd>Special keywords you specify. (See "C++ 
options," earlier in this chapter.) 

<dt><b>Keywords:</b> <dd>C/C++ keywords 

<dt><b>Current line:</b> <dd>The line containing the insert point 

<dt><b>Preprocessor:</b> <dd>C/C++ preprocessor directives 

<dt><b>Error highlight:</b> <dd>Lines on which compiler errors were found 
</dl>

Select Color and Font Style from the drop-down lists next to each 
item. (If you select the first color, which is labeled "none," the 
default text color is used for that item.) 


<h4>Selection/highlight color</h4>
Specifies the text and background color of selected text. 


<h4>Execution line color</h4>
Specifies the text and background color of the current execution line 
during debugging. 


<h3>Backup options</h3>

The Backup options set (Figure 21-31) contains options for backing 
up files. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure21_31.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 21-31 Backup options 

<h4>Autosave</h4>
Causes the editor to save your work automatically after a certain 
number of changes, or after a certain number of minutes since the 
last save. Specify the number of changes or minutes in the textbox, 
and select changes or minutes from the drop-down list. 


<h4>Backup on file save</h4>
This enables automatic backup on save. You must also select the 
backup method: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Create .bak File:</b> <dd>Copies the previous saved version to file with the 
extension .bak. 

<dt><b>Copy to backup directory:</b> <dd>Copies the previously saved version to 
another directory. Type the directory into the textbox, or click on 
Browse to select a directory from a <b>Directory</b> dialog box. 

<dt><b>Invoke OnBackup script:</b> <dd>Runs a macro called OnBackup. 
</dl>


<b>Note:</b> 
The Autosave option also provides some protection 
against data loss in the event of a system crash. 
When you check Autosave, the editor saves the 
contents of each modified buffer to a temporary file 
on disk. If the editor does not exit normally (as with 
a crash), these files (named <tt>~<i>num</i>.sav</tt>, where 
<tt><i>num</i></tt> is a unique number) will not be deleted. 
Line 1 of a <tt>.sav</tt> file specifies the drive, directory, 
name, and extension of the buffered file, also with 
the data and time it was last saved. The rest of the 
file stores the contents of the buffer, which you may 
be able to recover; use the editor's <b>Save As</b> option 
to save the <tt>.sav</tt> file as a source file. 


<hr>
<a name="globalfind"><h2>Using Global Find</h2></a>

Global Find is a multi-file search facility. You specify the files to be 
searched and the string or regular expression to be searched for. 
Global Find presents a list of files in which a match was found and 
allows you to view and edit the files, add files to the project, or 
refine the search criteria and search again. 


<h3>Defining the search</h3>

	<p>

The <b>Global Find</b> dialog box has two sections. The upper section 
specifies the files to be searched, and the lower section specifies the 
pattern to be searched for. 


<h3>Search Files...</h3>

Three options are available for specifying the files to be searched. 

<dl>
<dt><b>In the current project</b>
<dd>All files in the current project are searched. 

<dt><b>Currently listed in global search results window</b>
<dd>Enabled only after an initial global search has been performed. It 
limits the search to files in which a match was found in the previous 
global search. 

<dt><b>Matching the criteria</b>
<dd>Specify files by filename patterns, directory, date, time, 
and attributes. 


<dl>
<dt><b>File names:</b> <dd>Comma-separated list of filenames and patterns. To 
search all files, use *.*. 

<dt><b>Directory:</b> <dd>Search files in the specified directory. You can click on 
Browse to select a directory from the <b>Choose Directory</b> dialog box. 
Check Include Subdirectories to search files in subdirectories as well. 

<dt><b>Date:</b> <dd>Select Ignore to ignore the date. Otherwise, specify a date and 
one of the relational options. For example, specify On and 11/6/94 
to search files last modified on November 6, 1994, or After 4/1/90 
and to search files last modified after April 1, 1990. 

<dt><b>Time:</b> <dd>Select Ignore to ignore the time. Otherwise, specify a time and 
one of the relational options. 

<dt><b>Attributes:</b> <dd>Search files with the given attributes. File attributes are 
Archive, Read Only, System, and Hidden. 
<p>

The <b>Attributes</b> check boxes are three-state check boxes:
<dl>
<dt><i>checked</i> <dd>files with the given attribute are searched.
<dt><i>cleared</i> <dd>files without the given attribute are searched.
<dt><i>grayed</i> <dd>the attribute is ignored when deciding which 
files to search.
</dl> 

</dl>
</dl>


<h3>For...</h3>

Type the pattern to search for into the textbox.
These options modify the search: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Ignore case</b>
<dd>Do not consider case when searching for a match. 


<dt><b>Whole words only</b>
<dd>Consider text a match only if it is not part of a larger alphanumeric 
string. 


<dt><b>Regular expression</b>
<dd>Enables regular expression matching. 

A regular expression is a string with wildcards, which are:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>

	<tr>
	<td><b>?</b></td>
	<td>Matches any character.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>*</b></td>
	<td>Matches zero or more occurrences of any 
	character.</td> 
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>@</b></td>
	<td>Matches zero or more occurrences of the 
	previous character or expression. For 
	example, <tt>Ax@B</tt> matches <tt>AB</tt>, <tt>AxB</tt>, <tt>AxxB</tt>, and 
	so on.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>%</b></td>
	<td>Matches the beginning of a line. For example, 
	<tt>%{</tt> finds lines that start with left braces.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>&lt;</b></td>
	<td>Matches the beginning of a line. For example, 
	<tt>&lt;{</tt> finds lines that start with left braces.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>$</b></td>
	<td>Matches the end of a line. For example, <tt>$</tt> 
	finds blank lines.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>&gt;</b></td>
	<td>Matches the end of a line. For example, <tt>&gt;</tt> 
	finds blank lines.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>[</b>...<b>]</b></td>
	<td>Matches any of the characters listed between 
	the square brackets. A hyphen can be used to 
	specify a range of characters. For example, 
	<tt>[axz]</tt> matches a, x, or z; <tt>[a-z]</tt> matches 
	any lowercase letter.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>[~</b>...<b>]</b></td>
	<td>Matches any characters except those listed.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>\</b></td>
	<td>Escape character indicates that the following 
	character should be taken literally rather than 
	used as a wildcard character. For example, <tt>\%</tt> 
	matches a percent sign.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>\t</b></td>
	<td>Matches a tab character.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>\f</b></td>
	<td>Matches a formfeed character.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</dl>
