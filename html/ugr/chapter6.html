<h1>6. Editing Program Code</h1>

 
Program code is edited in Source windows. The Source window is a
full-featured text editor, with many options and features
particularly useful when editing C and C++ source code.
Subsets of Source window functionality are also available in the
Source pane of 
the Class Editor and in the Source child window of the Hierarchy 
Editor. 
<p>

In addition to its role in editing  project code, use the 
Source window for monitoring program execution while debugging. 
See Chapter 24,
<a href="chapter24.html">Commands Available in Debugging Mode</a>,
for more information. 
<p>

Chapter 21,
<a href="chapter21.html">Text Editor Reference</a>,
contains descriptions of all 
Source window menu commands, toolbar icons, dialog boxes, and 
options. Refer to it once you've read this chapter and you need more 
details about specific aspects of the editor. 
<p>

Refer to the Digital Mars C++ IDDE Help for the key combination
used to execute a particular editting command.
It 
contains a reference to all key combinations for every key binding 
set. 


<h2>Role of the Text Editor</h2>

The purpose of the IDDE text editor is to create, examine, and 
modify project source files. Because these files are standard 
text files, any text editor to work with 
them. However, the IDDE text editor is designed especially to edit C 
and C++ source files and to work in concert with other IDDE tools. 
<p>

Anyone familiar with Windows can get started quickly with the IDDE 
text editor because it uses standard Windows editing commands. In 
addition, the text editor has some features that make working with C 
and C++ files easier. For example, the editor can automatically 
indent or unindent after braces and can check delimiters. 
<p>

The text editor can display keywords, preprocessor 
directives, and comments in special font styles and colors. This 
technique helps track errors in source code while editing. 
For example, an unmatched comment (/* without a matching */) 
turns a large part of the code a different color, making it obvious 
where the problem lies. Keywords and preprocessor directives 
are easier to spot when they are in a different color or font style. 
Misspelled keywords can be caught immediately when they remain 
displayed in the default font. 
<p>


Source windows are an integral part of the IDDE environment and 
work together with other IDDE windows to make application 
development easier. For example, the IDDE automatically saves all 
files open in Source windows when you rebuild your project. During 
compilation, error messages are displayed in the Output window; 
double-clicking on an error message opens a 
Source window on the corresponding source file, if necessary, and 
then jumps to the line in the source code that caused the error. 


<h2>The Source Window</h2>

	<center>
	<img align="middle" alt="Source window" src="figure6_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-1 Source window]
	</center>
	<p>


Most work with a Source window is in the editing area. This 
is where text is displayed and edited, as described later in this 
chapter. The Source window contains a typical IDDE window menu 
and toolbar; a pop-up menu is available by right-clicking in the 
editing area. Complete information about the menus and toolbar is 
contained in Chapter 21,
<a href="chapter21.html">Text Editor Reference</a>.
<p>


The status bar, shown in Figure 6-2, provides information about the 
current state of the file being edited. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-2 Source window status bar]
	</center>

<dl>
<dt><b>Information string</b>
<dd>Displays information about the state of the current function. For 
example, the message <tt>Pattern not found</tt> is displayed when the 
<b>Find</b> command is unable to locate the specified pattern. 


<dt><b>Modification flag</b>
<dd>Displays <tt>Mod</tt> if the file has been modified since it
was last saved. 


<dt><b>Insertion mode</b>
<dd>Displays <tt>Ovr</tt> when the typing mode is set to overtype. When the 
typing mode is set to insert, nothing is displayed in this field. Toggle 
the insertion mode with the Insert key. 


<dt><b>Read-only flag</b>
<dd>Displays <tt>Rd</tt> when the file is set to read-only. When the file is in 
read/ write mode, nothing is displayed in this field. The read-only 
attribute is set in the <b>Current Buffer Options</b> dialog box described 
later in this chapter. 


<dt><b>Line number</b>
<dd>Displays the line number of the insertion point. 


<dt><b>Column number</b>
<dd>Displays the column position of the insertion point. 

</dl>

<h2>File Manipulation</h2>

The IDDE lets you open as many different files as your computer's 
memory allows. You can open multiple views of one file; changes 
made in one window will be made in all. 


<h3>Creating files</h3>

To create a new file, choose <b>New</b> from the IDDE's <b>File</b> menu. An 
empty Source window opens, and you can begin typing. Note that 
the new file is not actually created on disk until you save it. 


<h3>Opening files</h3>

To open a source file (or any text file), choose <b>Open</b> from the 
IDDE's <b>File</b> menu, or choose <b>Open</b> from a Source window's <b>File</b> 
menu. A standard Windows <b>File Open</b> dialog box is displayed. 
Select the file you want to edit and click OK. The file is opened for 
editing in a new Source window. 


There are additional ways to open a file for editing: 

<ul>
	<li> Choose a file from the list of recently opened files at the 
	bottom of the IDDE's or Source window's <b>File</b> menu. 

	<li> Double-click on a filename in the Project window. 

	<li> Click <b>New!</b> in a Source window to open another view of 
	the same file. 

	<li> Choose <b>Load</b> from the Source window's <b>File</b> menu. The 
	file you select opens in the same Source window, 
	replacing the previous file. 
</ul>

<h3>Saving files</h3>

To save the file in the active window, choose <b>Save</b> from the Source 
window's <b>File</b> menu. If the file is untitled, the editor displays the 
<b>File Save As</b> dialog box to let you name it. Otherwise, it saves the 
file under its current name. This procedure saves only the file in the 
active Source window. 
<p>


To save the files in all Source windows, choose <b>Save All</b> from the 
Source window's <b>File</b> menu. The editor displays the <b>Save As</b> dialog 
box for any untitled file. 
<p>

To save an unnamed file or a named file under a new name, choose 
<b>Save As</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. The text editor displays the <b>File Save 
As</b> dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-3. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_3.gif" width=466 height=244>
	<p>
	[Figure 6-3 File Save As dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

Enter a name for the file and click OK. 

<h3>Writing blocks of text to files</h3>

By choosing <b>Write Block</b> from the Source window's pop-up menu, 
you can write the currently selected text block to a new file or 
append the block to an existing file. This is useful when, for 
example, you want to remove some functions from a file and place 
them in a separate file. 


<h3>Printing files</h3>

To print the file in the active window, choose <b>Print</b> from the Source 
window's <b>File</b> menu. The <b>Text Print</b> dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 6-4. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-4 Text Print dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

The contents of the <b>Text Print</b> dialog box depend on the default 
printer you specify in the Windows control panel. Make any 
necessary changes in the dialog box, then click OK to print. 


<h3>Closing files</h3>

To close a file in a Source window, choose <b>Close</b> from the Source 
window's <b>File</b> menu, or click the close button. If you've edited the 
file since the last time it was saved, the IDDE displays a dialog box 
asking if you would like to save the file. 


<h2>Text Editing</h2>

This section describes the text editing features available in the 
Source window. 


<h3>Typing mode</h3>

Source windows support two typing modes: overtype, which 
replaces characters as you type; and insert, which adds new 
characters to the file. You can toggle the typing mode between 
overtype and insert modes by using the Insert key. (Press Alt+I if you 
selected the Brief key binding set.) The typing mode is displayed in 
the status bar. A change in typing mode applies to all open Source 
windows, not just to the active window. 


<h3>Word wrap</h3>

Because the editor is designed for source files, word wrap is not 
enabled by default. You must press the Enter key to start a new line. 
When you type past the right edge of the window, the text scrolls 
horizontally. You can enable word wrap and set a right margin either 
locally or globally using the text editor options. 


<h3>Indentation</h3>

By default, the editor automatically indents a new line to the same 
depth as the previous line. You can set several indentation options, 
such as autoindent, tab width, and indent/ unindent after braces. 
<p>


It also is possible to change the indentation of a selected block of 
text by choosing <b>Indent Block</b> or <b>Unindent Block</b> from the 
<b>Format Text</b> submenu of the Source window's pop-up menu. 


<h3>Moving around in a file</h3>

You can move the insertion point in a file by using the mouse or 
keyboard in the standard Windows text-editing manner. In addition, 
you can jump to specific points in a file using commands from the 
Source window's <b>Goto</b> menu. 


<h4>Jumping to a matching delimiter</h4>

A common source of problems in C and C++ programming is 
parentheses (()), brackets ([]), and braces ({}) that don't match. 
To find the other half of a pair of these delimiters, position the 
insertion point in front of one of the delimiters and choose 
<b>Matching Delimiter</b> from the <b>Goto</b> menu. The insertion point then 
moves to the front of the other half of the pair. 
<p>


Delimiter checking can also be done automatically using the text 
editor options described later in this chapter. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
The IDDE editor looks for any parenthesis, bracket, 
or brace, including text in strings and comments. 


<h4>Jumping to a specific line</h4>

To jump to a specific line, choose <b>Line</b> from the <b>Goto</b> menu. The 
<b>Goto Line</b> dialog box, shown in Figure 6-5, opens. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_5.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-5 Goto Line dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

Type the line number in the textbox and click OK. The editor moves 
the insertion point to the beginning of the specified line. 


<h4>Jumping to a function</h4>

To jump to a specific function, choose <b>Function</b> from the <b>Goto</b> 
menu. The <b>Goto Function</b> dialog box, shown in Figure 6-6, opens. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-6 Goto Function dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

You can select a function name from the scrolling list or type in a 
function name. The insertion point then moves to the beginning of 
the specified function. 


<h4>Jumping to a bookmark</h4>

The IDDE text editor lets you position bookmarks anywhere in your 
files by choosing <b>Bookmark</b> from the Source window's <b>Goto</b> menu. 
The <b>Bookmarks</b> dialog box, shown in Figure 6-7, opens. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-7 Bookmarks dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

To use bookmarks, first position the insertion point where you want 
the bookmark to be located. Then choose <b>Bookmark</b> from the <b>Goto</b> 
menu, select a bookmark, and click on the Drop button. When you 
want to return to this location, click on this entry's name in the list of 
bookmarks, then click on Goto. 


<h3>Selecting text</h3>

Text selection is accomplished using one of two standard 
techniques: clicking and dragging the mouse or shift-clicking. The 
IDDE text editor provides additional modes for text selection using 
the <b>Column</b> and <b>Line</b> commands in the pop-up menu's <b>Select</b> 
submenu. 
<p>

Both commands require that you first select a block of text in the 
standard manner. <b>Column</b> changes the currently selected text block 
into a column-oriented select block; only the characters in the 
columns between the start and end of the original text block are 
selected. This is shown in Figure 6-8. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_8.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-8 A column select block]
	</center>
	<p>

<b>Line</b> changes the currently selected text block into a line-oriented 
select block; all the lines from the start to the end of the original text 
block, including the first and last lines, are selected. 
<p>


This is shown in Figure 6-9. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_9.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-9 A line select block]
	</center>
	<p>

Choosing <b>Normal</b> from the <b>Select</b> submenu of the pop-up menu 
changes a column-or line-oriented text block back to the original 
selection. <b>Cancel</b> deselects the current selection block; this can also 
be accomplished by clicking somewhere outside the selected text. 
<p>


The text editor supplies standard Windows functions for cutting, 
copying, pasting, and deleting text. These functions can be accessed 
through either the <b>Edit</b> menu or the pop-up menu. In addition, by 
clicking and dragging a block of selected text, you can reposition the 
text anywhere in the buffer. Press the Control key while releasing 
the block to copy rather than move the block. When you are 
dragging text blocks around in this way, a small outlined box is 
drawn next to the cursor to indicate this mode. 


<h3>Searching and replacing</h3>

The IDDE editor has powerful text-based search and replace 
functions that let you search open files for a string and replace one 
string with another. In addition, you can search through any set of 
source files, whether or not they are open or in your project. 

<h4>Finding a string</h4>

To search for a string, choose <b>Find</b> from the Source window's <b>Edit</b> 
menu. The dialog box shown in Figure 6-10 opens. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_10.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-10 Find dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

If you select some text before opening the <b>Find</b> dialog box, the 
selected text becomes the default search pattern. You can either use 
this text as it appears, select a previous string from the drop-down 
list, or type in a new string. Then click on the Next (or Previous) 
button. The editor locates and selects the next (or previous) 
occurrence of the string in the active file. You can repeat the search 
in the same direction by choosing <b>Repeat Find</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu. 
If the pattern is not found, the editor returns to the current insertion 
point and displays Pattern not found in the status line. 
<p>

By checking Regular Expression in the <b>Find</b> dialog box, you can use 
the wildcard characters ? and * in your search string. The ? 
character matches any single character, while the * character 
matches any string of consecutive characters. Regular expressions 
permit more powerful text searches. 


<h4>Replacing a string</h4>

To replace an occurrence of a string in your file with another string, 
choose <b>Replace</b> from the Source window's <b>Edit</b> menu. The <b>Replace</b> 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-11. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_11.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-11 Replace dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

Type the search string or regular expression in the <b>Pattern</b> textbox, 
just as you did in the <b>Find</b> dialog box described earlier. Then type 
the replacement string in the Replacement textbox. Note that 
wildcards cannot be used in the Replacement textbox. You can also 
select previous search and replacement strings from the drop-down 
list. Begin the replacement by clicking OK. 
<p>


If you check the Confirm Changes option, the editor scrolls the 
display to each occurrence of the search string, selects it, and asks 
whether you want to replace it by displaying the <b>Confirm 
Replacement</b> dialog box in Figure 6-12. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_12.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-12 Confirm Replacement dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

Click on Yes to replace the string and continue searching, or click on 
No to continue searching without replacing. Click on Cancel to stop 
searching. If you do not check Confirm Changes, the editor replaces 
all occurrences of the search string without confirmation messages. 
<p>


You can use the <b>Undo</b> command to undo the entire set of 
replacements of the search string. 


<h4>Searching through multiple files</h4>

The text editor's global find feature provides a powerful means of 
locating a string in any set of files. For example, this feature is useful 
for: 

<ul>
<li> Locating undefined symbols 
<li> Changing function, variable, or class names 
<li> Fixing references to a function with changed parameters 
</ul>


To search for a string in multiple files, choose <b>Global Find</b> from the 
Source window's <b>Edit</b> menu. 
<p>


The <b>Global Find</b> dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-13. 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_13.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-13 Global Find dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

To perform a global search, first specify the set of source files you 
want to search. You can choose to search: 

<ul>
<li> All source files in the current project 

<li> All files listed in the Search window (which opens after 
the first search) 

<li> All files matching the criteria you specify, including 
filename, directory, date, time, and file attributes 
</ul>


Next, specify the string or regular expression to search for. (As with 
the <b>Find</b> command, you can preselect the search text before 
choosing <b>Global Find</b>.) When you click OK, the editor opens the 
Search window. The editor searches through the indicated files and 
lists the names of files containing a match in the Search window. 
<p>


By double-clicking on a filename, you can open the file; the first 
occurrence of the pattern is highlighted. You can continue searching 
for your string or expression in that file by choosing <b>Repeat Find</b> 
from the Source window's <b>Edit</b> menu. For more information, see 
Chapter 21,
<a href="chapter21.html">Text Editor Reference</a>.


<h3>Undoing edits</h3>

You can undo typing, cutting, pasting, and string-replace operations 
by choosing <b>Undo</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu. Undo multiple edits by 
repeatedly selecting the <b>Undo</b> command. You can set the number of 
editing operations that can be undone in the text editor options. 


<h2>Text Editor Options</h2>

Global text editor options are set in the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> 
dialog box, shown in Figure 6-14. To open this dialog box, choose 
<b>Text Settings</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu. (You can also choose <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b>
from the <b>Environment</b> menu; in this case you 
will have access to Class and Hierarchy Editor options as well.) 

	<p>
	<center>
	<img align="middle" src="figure6_14.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 6-14 Editing/ Browsing Settings dialog box]
	</center>
	<p>

The <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box is a tabbed dialog that 
contains numerous options for different aspects of the text editor: 

<ul>
<li> The Text page contains options for indentation, cursor 
styles, keyboard emulation, and text editor font. 

<li> The C++ page lets you set options to enable C++ mode 
globally, check delimiters, indent after braces, auto-align 
comments, and add keywords to the keyword dictionary. 

<li> The Keys page lets you customize key bindings and 
assign key combinations to macros. 

<li> The Display page lets you select special colors and font 
styles for keywords, comments, and preprocessor 
symbols. 

<li> The Backup page lets you set options for backing up 
files. 

<li> The General page lets you set the maximum undo level 
and select a key binding file. 
</ul>


Several text editor options can be set on a buffer-by-buffer basis. To 
set these local options, choose <b>Current Buffer Settings</b> from the 
<b>Edit</b> menu. The <b>Current Buffer Options</b> dialog box, shown in

This dialog lets you override global indentation options, set word 
wrap, and set the buffer to read-only.

You can find detailed information about text editor options in 
Chapter 21,
<a href="chapter21.html">Text Editor Reference</a>.


<h3>Macros</h3>

The text editor has powerful macro facilities. You can record a 
sequence of keystrokes, save the sequence as a named macro, assign 
a keyboard shortcut to the macro, place the macro in the <b>Macro</b> 
menu, edit the macro, and so on. To record a macro, choose <b>Record 
Macro</b> from the <b>Macro</b> menu; to end the macro, choose <b>Stop 
Recording</b>. You can play back the stored sequence by choosing 
<b>Play Macro</b>. 


<h2>Compiling Files and Checking Errors</h2>

The IDDE makes it easy to iteratively edit and check your source 
code. To save and compile the current buffer, choose <b>Compile</b> from 
the Source window's <b>File</b> menu. The IDDE compiles the file using 
the current project build settings. If the compilation is successful, the 
file is marked as compiled. If the compilation generated errors, you 
can quickly locate the line in your source code that generated the 
error by double-clicking on the error in the Output window. 
<p>

For more information about compiling files and building the project, 
see Chapter 8,
