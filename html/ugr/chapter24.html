<h1>24. Commands Available in Debugging Mode</h1>


This chapter describes the commands available in debug windows. 
The IDDE has several windows dedicated to debugging, each with a 
different view of a program and a specific set of commands for 
manipulating or examining the program during a debugging session. 
<p>

The descriptions of the debug windows and their menu commands 
follow, in alphabetical order. Each window's commands are 
discussed in the order in which they are listed in the menu bar.

<a name="windows"><h2>Debug Windows and Commands</h2></a>


Using the debug windows, the Digital Mars C++ debugger gives you up 
to 18 different kinds of views into a program's state at run-time. You 
open these windows from the Views toolbox (see
Chapter 2, "Introducing the IDDE" ). 
<p>

Because many of the commands associated with these views are 
applicable only while a specific window is active, each debug 
window has its own menu, located below the window's title bar. 
<p>


A window's commands are available only while that window is 
active. For example, because you would not set a breakpoint when 
using the Call window, no breakpoint commands appear among the 
Call window's menus. Because setting breakpoints is a typical 
source-level operation, several breakpoint commands are available 
when the Source window is active. 


<h3>Drag and drop</h3>

One of the IDDE's unique features is the ability to drag and drop 
updated information between debug windows, saving you the 
trouble of choosing menu commands. This chapter covers all the 
valid drag-and-drop operations among the IDDE's debug windows. 


<h3>Accelerator keys</h3>

You can also execute most debug window commands through an 
accelerator key combination (a function key or a Control key 
combination). For example, you can choose the <b>Start/Restart 
Debugging</b> command by pressing F4. A command's description 
provides the accelerator key combination (if any) that invokes it. 


<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="assembly"><h2>The Assembly Window</h2></a>

The Assembly window, shown in Figure 24-1, displays the 
disassembled instructions of your program at a selected memory 
location. The Assembly window's menus (<b>View</b>, <b>Bpt</b>, and <b>Others</b>)
let you set and clear assembly-level breakpoints, set the disassembly 
address, and determine the amount of symbolic information to 
display. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-1 Assembly window 
	<p>

The header line in the Assembly window (below the menu bar) 
displays the module and function for the currently highlighted 
assembly instruction. The first column of information in the window 
area shows code addresses of the assembly instructions. If you 
choose the <b>Source</b> command from the <b>View</b> menu to enable the 
interleaved display of C++ source code, this column also shows the 
line numbers of source-level statements. 
<p>


If you execute the <b>Step Into</b> (F8) or <b>Step Over</b> (F10) commands 
from the IDDE's <b>Debug</b> menu while the Assembly window is active, 
the debugger steps at the assembly level as opposed to at the source 
level. For more information on controlling the execution of the 
debugged program, refer to
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger." 
<p>


By default, the disassembly location is set to the address of the next 
statement to be executed. However, by using the <b>Set Disassembly 
Address</b> command in the <b>Others</b> menu, you can select another 
address to disassemble. 
<p>


The arrow, located to the left of the code address, indicates where 
execution has currently stopped. 
<p>


When <b>Opcodes</b> is checked in the <b>View</b> menu, the first column 
contains source code addresses. The second column displays source-level 
information and/or assembly instructions. The last column 
displays opcodes for each assembly instruction if <b>Source</b> is checked 
in the <b>View</b> menu. 
<p>


The Assembly window has three menus (shown in Table 24-1) in the 
debuggers: <b>View</b>, <b>Bpt</b>, and <b>Others</b>. 

<pre>
	Table 24-1 Assembly window commands 

	<b>Menu	Menu Item			Shortcut</b> 
	View	Symbols				none 
		Source				none 
		Opcodes				none 
	Bpt	Set/Clear Breakpoint		Ctrl+S/Ctrl+F9 
		Set Conditional Breakpoint	Ctrl+B 
		Clear All Breakpoints		Ctrl+K 
	Others	Set Disassembly Address		Ctrl+A 
		Jump To Line			Ctrl+J 
</pre>

The menu items in the Assembly window are described next. 

<h3>View menu</h3>

This menu sets the display modes of the Assembly window. The 
Assembly window displays assembly language code mixed with 
symbols and source, as well as opcodes. A checkmark indicates the 
current display mode. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-2 Assembly window View menu 

<h4>Symbols</h4>
Enables disassembled instructions mixed with symbolic information 
such as variable names, function calls, and function entry points. 


<h4>Source</h4>
Enables disassembled instructions mixed with the corresponding 
source code (if debugging information is available for the 
disassembled module). 


<h4>Opcodes</h4>
Toggles the display of assembly instruction opcodes. 


<h3>Bpt menu</h3>

The <b>Bpt</b> Menu commands set and clear breakpoints at the assembly 
language level in the program. See the section "Working with 
Breakpoints," in
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger,"
for information on how to use breakpoints. 


<h4>Set/Clear Breakpoint</h4>
Sets an unconditional breakpoint at the selected assembly line. The 
next time a <b>Go</b> command is executed (except the <b>Go until End</b> 
command), execution of the program stops when it reaches this line. 
If a breakpoint is already set on the selected assembly line, this 
command clears that breakpoint. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-3 Assembly window Bpt menu 
	<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
To set a breakpoint, you can drag and drop from 
the Assembly window to the Breakpoint window. 
The presence of a breakpoint is indicated by a solid 
black diamond to the left of the instruction's 
address. You can move the breakpoint to a different 
line by dragging the black diamond to a different 
line. Drop the diamond outside the window to clear 
the breakpoint. 


<h4>Set Conditional Breakpoint</h4>
Opens the <b>Set Code Breakpoint</b> dialog box. You use this dialog 
box to set a conditional breakpoint at the selected assembly line. 


<h4>Clear All Breakpoints</h4>
Clears all breakpoints set anywhere in the program. 


<h3>Others menu</h3>

Using the <b>Others</b> menu, you can set a particular disassembly 
location and change the execution location. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-4 Assembly window Others menu 


<h4>Set Disassembly Address</h4>
Sets the disassembly address. When this command is executed, the 
debugger prompts you to enter an address. In the dialog box, enter a 
hexadecimal address conforming to the language in use for the 
expression evaluator. (See Appendix A, "Expression Evaluation.") 

For <i>segment:offset</i> addressing, use the following format: 

<pre>
	0x<i>nnnn</i>:0x<i>nnnn</i> 
</pre>

where <i>nnnn</i> is a 4-digit hexadecimal number. You may omit the 
segment address (and the colon) to specify an address in the same 
segment as the one currently displayed. If you are running in the 
32-bit flat memory model, specify the address in the following form: 

<pre>
	0x<i>nnnnnnnn</i> 
</pre>

where <i>nnnnnnnn</i> is an 8-digit hexadecimal number. 


<h4>Jump to Line</h4>
Changes the execution location of the current thread to the selected 
assembly line. (The execution location, also known as the instruction 
pointer, is stored in the CS: IP or EIP registers.) To execute the <b>Jump 
To Line</b> command, select the assembly line where you want 
execution to resume, then press Ctrl+ J. 
<p>

The <b>Jump to Line</b> command simulates a jump instruction, skipping 
sections of code without executing them. When stepping through 
the program, it continues executing from the new location. 


<h3>Pop-up menu</h3>

You can access the Assembly window pop-up menu by pressing the 
right mouse button anywhere in the window. The pop-up menu 
provides quick access to three commands: <b>Set/Clear Breakpoint</b>, 
<b>Set Conditional Breakpoint</b>, and <b>Jump to Line</b>. These commands 
are described above. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_5.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-5 Assembly window pop-up menu 


<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="breakpoint"><h2>The Breakpoint Window</h2></a>

The Breakpoint window, shown in Figure 24-6, displays status 
information about all breakpoints set in the program. Breakpoint 
window commands show the source location of a breakpoint and 
clear, set, enable, or disable breakpoints. 
<p>

When a breakpoint in the Source, Assembly, or Spy windows is set, 
cleared, or triggered, the status of the breakpoint is displayed in this 
window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-6 Breakpoint window 
	<p>

The Breakpoint window lists all breakpoints currently defined in the 
program. You can view the different parameters of any breakpoint 
and enable or disable the currently defined breakpoint. 
<p>

The Breakpoint window displays the following information for every 
line:Location, Address, Count/Limit, Act, Condition, and Action 
Expr. 

<dl>
<dt><b>Location:</b> <dd>Gives the name of the module in which the breakpoint is 
set, followed by the function name and the line number in the 
module. 

<dt><b>Address:</b> <dd>Provides the code address of the breakpoint setting. 

<dt><b>Count/Limit:</b> <dd>Displays the number of times the breakpoint is 
triggered. If you specify a break Condition, the count is the number 
of times the breakpoint has been reached with the specified 
expression evaluating to TRUE. The limit is the number of times the 
breakpoint must be reached for it to be triggered. This field is 
displayed only if you have specified a limit. 

<dt><b>Act:</b> <dd>Corresponds to the Action field in the <b>Set Code Breakpoint</b> 
dialog box. It can contain either or both of the characters B or E, or 
nothing. If B is present, execution breaks when it reaches this 
breakpoint location. (If a break condition is specified, execution 
breaks only if the Condition expression evaluates to TRUE when the 
location is reached.) If E is present, the Action Expr. field (see 
below) is evaluated every time the breakpoint is reached. 

<dt><b>Condition:</b> <dd>Shows the expression entered for a conditional 
breakpoint. This expression is evaluated every time execution 
reaches this breakpoint location. If the expression evaluates to TRUE 
and the Action field contains B, execution stops. 

<dt><b>Action Expr.:</b> <dd>The expression entered for a conditional breakpoint 
to be evaluated at each breakpoint hit. If you specify a Condition, 
the action expression is evaluated only if the Condition expression 
evaluates to TRUE. This expression is evaluated every time the 
execution reaches this breakpoint location if the Action field contains 
E. Evaluation does not stop execution of the program unless the 
Action field also contains B. 
</dl>

You can set a breakpoint on any program statement in the Source 
window or on any assembly instruction in the Assembly window, 
with no limit to the number of breakpoints set. 
<p>

The Breakpoint window has two menus, as shown in Table 24-2: 
<b>Show</b> and <b>Bpt</b>. 

<pre>
	Table 24-2 Breakpoint window commands 

	<b>Menu	Menu Item			Shortcut</b> 
	Show	Source				Ctrl+S 
		Assembly			Ctrl+A 
	Bpt	Set Breakpoint			F9 
		Set Conditional Breakpoint	Ctrl+B 
		Clear Breakpoint		Ctrl+C 
		Clear All Breakpoints		Ctrl+K 
		Enable Breakpoint		Ctrl+E 
		Disable Breakpoint		Ctrl+D 
</pre>

The Breakpoint window menus are described next. 

<h3>Show menu</h3>

The <b>Show</b> menu commands show the Source and Assembly 
windows, positioned at the selected breakpoint. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-7 Breakpoint window Show menu 


<h4>Source</h4>
Opens the Source window if it is not already open, makes it the 
active window, and positions its contents to display the selected 
breakpoint. Double-clicking on a source-code breakpoint in the 
Breakpoint window or dragging and dropping from the Breakpoint 
window to the Source window also executes this command. 


<h4>Assembly</h4>
Updates the Assembly window, if it is open, to display the assembly 
location of the selected breakpoint. Dragging and dropping from the 
Breakpoint window to the Assembly window also executes this 
command. 


<h3>Bpt menu</h3>

<b>Bpt</b> menu commands set breakpoints, clear individual breakpoints 
or all breakpoints, and enable and disable breakpoints. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_8.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-8 Breakpoint window Bpt menu 


<h4>Set Breakpoint</h4>
Displays an <b>Expression</b> dialog box. To set an unconditional 
breakpoint, type the address and press Enter. You also can enter a 
symbolic name, such as the name of a procedure. The new 
breakpoint is added to the Breakpoint window. After executing any 
Go command (except the <b>Go until End</b> command), execution of the 
program stops when it reaches this line. 


<h4>Set Conditional Breakpoint</h4>
Displays an <b>Expression</b> dialog box. To set a conditional breakpoint, 
type the address or a procedure name and press Enter. The 
debugger displays the <b>Set Code Breakpoint</b> dialog box. In this 
dialog box, you specify the condition of the breakpoint. 


<h4>Clear Breakpoint</h4>
Clears the selected breakpoint. 

<h4>Clear All Breakpoints</h4>
Clears all breakpoints set in the program. 


<h4>Enable Breakpoint</h4>
Enables the selected breakpoint (if currently disabled). 


<h4>Disable Breakpoint</h4>
Disables the selected breakpoint (if currently enabled). Use this 
command to temporarily disable a breakpoint that you can later 
enable without having to set it again. 


<h3>Pop-up Menu</h3>

The Breakpoint window pop-up menu allows you to access 
frequently used commands quickly. You can bring up the pop-up 
menu by pressing the right mouse button anywhere in the 
Breakpoint window. The five commands in the pop-up menu appear 
in other Breakpoint window menus and are described in detail in the 
preceding sections.

	[Figure 24-9 Breakpoint window pop-menu 

<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="call"><h2>The Call Window</h2></a>

The Call window, shown in Figure 24-10, lists the function calls a 
program has made since it began running. The entries in this list, 
often referred to as the call chain, are displayed in reverse 
chronological order, from the last (most recent) call to the first 
(initial) call. 
<p>

Each entry lists the name of the function called, followed by the 
name of the module containing that function. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_10.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-10 Call window 
	<p>

Use the Call window to display: 

<ul>
	<li> The source-level and assembly-level execution location 
	of any function 

	<li> The local data of any function in the call chain 
</ul>

If no function calls have been made or all function calls have 
returned, the Call window displays one of the two following status 
messages: 

<pre>
	No call chain (loading) 

	No call chain (terminating) 
</pre>

If the call chain is invalid, the Call window displays the following 
message: 

<pre>
	No call chain (error) 
</pre>

If no debugging information is available for a function in the call 
chain, its entry in the Call window is displayed as: 

<pre>
	PROCEDURE AT <i>segment:offset</i> 
</pre>

where <i>segment:offset</i> is the address of the function called. In the 
32-bit flat memory model, addresses are displayed as 8-digit 
hexadecimal numbers rather than in <i>segment:offset</i> format. 
<p>

If no local symbols are available, the address is displayed as: 

<pre>
	Unknown Procedure 
</pre>

The Call window's local <b>Show</b> menu is shown in Table 24-3.

The menu items in the Call window are described in the following 
section. 


<h3>Show menu</h3>

<b>Show</b> menu commands update the position and information 
displayed in the Source, Data, and Assembly windows. Use these 
commands to view local data and the source-or assembly-level 
execution position of the selected function in the Call window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_11.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-11 Call window Show menu 

<h4>Source</h4>
Opens the Source window (if not already open), makes it the active 
window, and updates it to show the source-level location at which 
the selected function is executing. Dragging and dropping from the 
Call window to the Source window or double-clicking on the line in 
the Call window also executes this command. 


<h4>Data</h4>
Updates the Data/Object window to show the local data and variable 
information of the selected function. Dragging and dropping from 
the Call window to the Data/Object window also executes this 
command. 


<h4>Functions</h4>
Updates the Function window to show the current entry in the call 
chain. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
Dragging and dropping from the Call window to the 
Function window shows all functions in the module 
in which the selected entry in the Call window 
resides. 


<h4>Assembly</h4>
Updates the Assembly window to show the assembly-level location 
at which the selected function is executing. Dragging and dropping 
from the Call window to the Assembly window also executes this 
command. 


<h4>All</h4>
Updates the Source, Data, and Assembly windows. You also can 
double-click on a call chain entry to execute this command. 


<h4>Code Address</h4>
Displays the code address of the selected function in a message box. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
Dragging and dropping from the Call window to the 
Memory window displays memory contents starting 
at the instruction pointer address of the selected 
entry in the Call window.

<a name="console"><h2>The Console Window</h2></a>

The Console window displays the output of a text-mode program 
that is being debugged. This is not a debugger window but rather an 
independent window under the control of the program. 
<p>

The Console window looks and behaves much like a DOS Window. 
It cannot be closed during program execution; choose <b>Stop 
Debugging</b> to terminate the application. 
<p>

In the debugger, the IDDE's Flip Screen option affects the Console 
window. (This option is described in
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger.")
When the debugger executes the text-mode 
program, the output is displayed in the foreground by default. 
Choosing Flip Screen allows you to control whether or not the 
debugger displays the Console window while it executes your 
program. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
Do not turn off the Flip Screen option when 
working in text mode unless the program you are 
working with has no output. 
<p>

The Console window has no local menus. 


<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="dataobject"><h2>The Data/Object Window</h2></a>

The Data/Object window, shown in Figure 24-14, displays the local 
variables, global (including static) variables, and objects in the 
program. The header line indicates the function or module for the 
local or global variables that are displayed. Each line in the Data/
Object window shows a different variable (or element of a variable), 
together with its name, value, and type. 
<p>

This view makes it easy to examine the elements of structures and 
arrays, as well as the contents of pointers and sets. Use the Data/
Object window to set watchpoints on data or to modify data. You 
can view a graphical representation of any data structure using the 
Graphic Data window, described later in this chapter. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_14.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-14 Data/Object window 
	<p>

The Module and Call windows can update the Data/Object window 
to display global and local data, respectively. After the variable 
information is displayed in the Data/Object window, you can 
examine and modify it. 
<p>


The Data/Object window supports the display of C++ data type 
names either in the form member::class or in the form class::member. 
To control how these data type names are displayed, use the 
Alternate Class Display option in the <b>Debugger Settings</b> dialog box 
described in
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger." 
<p>


If you didn't select a module or function to show data for, the 
Data/Object window displays the message: 

<pre>
	No data context selected 
</pre>

If the debugger attempts to show local data for a function that does 
not have any local data, the Data/Object window displays the global 
data of the module the function resides in. If there is no local or 
global data available to view, the Data/Object window displays the 
message: 

<pre>
	No global data 
</pre>

Before execution has started or after it has terminated, the Data/
Object window displays the message: 

<pre>
	No local data (no call chain) 
</pre>

Table 24-5 shows the Data/Object window commands.

The menu items in the Data/Object window are described below. 


<h3>Find menu</h3>

<b>Find</b> menu commands locate variables in the current scope and in 
all modules. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_15.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-15 Data/Object window Find menu 

<h4>In Current Scope</h4>
Displays a dialog box that allows you to enter the name of the 
variable to find. Enter the name of the variable (or field) for which 
you want to search, and press Enter. The standard wildcards 
(* and ?) are supported in the name specification; case is significant. 
The debugger searches in the current scope for the variable and 
selects the line with that variable in the Data/Object window. If there 
is more than one local variable with the same name, you can 
continue the search using <b>Next</b>. 


<h4>In All Modules</h4>
Displays a dialog box that allows you to enter the name of the 
variable to find. Enter the name of the global variable (or field) you 
want to search for and press Enter. The standard wildcards 
(* and ?) are supported in the name specification; case is 
significant. The debugger searches all the modules for the variable 
and selects that line in the Data/Object window. If there is more than 
one global variable with the same name, continue the search using 
<b>Next</b>. 


<h4>Next</h4>
Repeats the last search executed using a <b>Find</b> command. 


<h3>View menu</h3>

Commands in the <b>View</b> menu let you navigate within data structures 
and arrays, toggle between displaying local and global data, and 
toggle the inclusion of methods in the display. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_16.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-16 Data/Object window View menu 

<h4>Child/Contents</h4>
Displays the next level of the data structure beneath the selected 
data structure, allowing you to navigate down through arrays, 
structures, and pointers to view their elements. You may also 
double-click on a data item to execute the <b>Child/Contents</b> 
command on it. This command operates in the following manner: 


<ul>
	<li> If the selected item is an array, the Data/Object window 
	displays the list of elements in the array, one element per 
	line. The name of each element is its index value in the 
	array. Examine and modify an array element just as you 
	would any other variable. 

	<li> If the selected item is an instance of a class, the 
	Data/Object window displays its data members and their 
	values. 

	<li> If the selected item is a record or structure, the 
	Data/Object window displays the names and values of 
	the structure elements. 

	<li> If the selected item is a pointer, the Data/Object window 
	displays the object it points to. 

	<li> If the selected item is a function, module, or method, the 
	Data/Object window displays the message: 
	<p>

	This data is not structured 
	<p>

	<li> If the selected item is a nested block, the Data/Object 
	window displays the variables declared in the nested 
	local scope. 
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> 
For faster compilation, Digital Mars C++ can optionally 
compile C++ modules without class debugging 
information. However, you cannot view objects 
(instances of classes) or structures in such modules 
unless you recompile with class debugging 
information. 


<h4>Parent</h4>
Displays the parent data structure of the current data structure. This 
command lets you move up a level in the data structure you 
previously moved down in with the <b>Child/Contents</b> command. 
When the <b>Parent</b> command is executed, the Data/Object window 
displays the structure one level up from the current data structure. 


<h4>Right (Next Element)</h4>
Displays the next index of the current array. If you use the 
<b>Child/Contents</b> command to view the elements of an array, use the 
<b>Right (Next Element)</b> command to quickly select the next index in 
the array. 


<h4>Left (Prev. Element)</h4>
Displays the previous index of the current array. If you used the 
<b>Child/Contents</b> command to view the elements of an array, use this 
command to quickly select the previous index in the array. 


<h4>Specific Index</h4>
Specifies a particular index to view in the array. If you used the 
<b>Child/Contents</b> command to view the elements of an array, this 
command lets you quickly view the contents of a specific index in 
the array. 
<p>

When this command is executed, the debugger prompts you to enter 
an expression to be evaluated. The result of the evaluation becomes 
the index of the newly displayed or selected array element. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
Use any one of the commands <b>Right (Next 
Element)</b>, <b>Left (Prev. Element)</b>, or <b>Specific 
Index</b> when you are viewing the fields of an array 
element. The Data/Object window displays the 
fields of the array with the new index. 
<p>

For example, if there is an array of records and the 
record fields of the first element of the array are 
displayed, you can use the <b>Right (Next Element)</b> 
command to directly view the record fields of the 
second element of the array. This is faster than 
executing the <b>Parent</b> command, changing the 
selection to the next index, and executing the 
<b>Child/Contents</b> command. 


<h4>Variable Level</h4>
Returns to the top nesting level (the variable level) of the data 
display. Use this command if you chose the <b>Child/Contents</b> 
command to descend into a data structure and want to return to the 
top variable level without repeatedly using the <b>Parent</b> command. 


<h4>Local/Global Data</h4>
Toggles the data view between the current function's local variables 
and the global variables of the current module. The command 
toggles between the local data of a function and the global data of 
the module that contains the function. 


<h4>Methods in Class</h4>
Toggles on and off the option to view the methods in C++ objects. 
Use this command if you don't want to view methods mixed with 
data items. 


<h3>Show menu</h3>

The <b>Show</b> menu is used to update the Graphic Data, Memory, and 
Source windows to reflect the selected item in the Data/Object 
window. It also is used to display the location— an address or a CPU 
register -- of the currently selected item. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_17.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-17 Data/Object window Show menu 

<h4>Graphic Data Structure</h4>
Select this menu item to display a graphic data representation of the 
selected variable. A drawing of the selected data structure is 
displayed in the Graphic Data window. This command provides a 
visual overview of your structure, in addition to the data browsing 
capabilities provided by the Data/Object window. For information 
about the Graphic Data display, see the section "The Graphic Data 
Window," later in this chapter. 
<p>

Dragging and dropping from the Data/Object window to the 
Graphic Data window also executes this command. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
The <b>Graphic Data Structure</b> command is disabled 
if there are not enough Windows resources 
available to generate a view for the Graphic Data 
window. 


<h4>Memory</h4>
Updates the Memory window to display the memory location of the 
variable selected in the Data/Object window. Dragging and 
dropping from the Data/Object window to the Memory window also 
executes this command. 


<h4>Source of Method</h4>
Updates the Source window to the location of the code for the 
method highlighted in the Data/Object window. 


<h4>Address</h4>
Displays the memory location of the selected variable at the left of 
the menu bar. If the variable is a register variable, this command 
displays the register( s) it is contained in on the status line. 


<h3>Expr menu</h3>

Commands in the <b>Expr</b> menu let you evaluate expressions, change 
the value of a variable, and convert values between decimal and 
hexadecimal. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_18.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-18 Data/Object window Expr menu 

<h4>Evaluate Expression</h4>
Opens an <b>Expression</b> dialog box. In the text field, enter the 
expression you want to evaluate. Use this command to modify a 
variable. 
<p>

See Appendix A, "Expression Evaluation," for more information on 
entering and evaluating expressions. 


<h4>Convert Decimal to Hex</h4>
Converts a decimal value to hexadecimal and displays the result on 
the status line. 


<h4>Convert Hex to Decimal</h4>
Converts a hexadecimal value to decimal, and displays the result on 
the status line. 


<h3>Bpt menu</h3>

The <b>Bpt</b> menu contains commands to set and clear breakpoints on 
methods in the Data/Object window. Refer to
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger,"
for details on the types 
of breakpoints that can be set. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_19.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-19 Data/Object window Bpt menu 

<h4>Set/Clear Breakpoint on Method</h4>
Sets a breakpoint on the method currently selected in the 
Data/Object window or clears a breakpoint that is currently set in 
the selected method. Dragging and dropping from the Data/Object 
window to the Breakpoint window also executes this command. 


<h4>Set Conditional Breakpoint on Method</h4>
Sets a conditional breakpoint in the method currently highlighted in 
the Data/Object window. 


<h4>Clear All Breakpoints</h4>
Clears all breakpoints in the program. 


<h3>Watch menu</h3>

Commands in the <b>Watch</b> menu are used to control data watchpoints 
in the program. When a watchpoint is set on a variable, a change in 
the variable's value or the implementation of a read access to the 
variable causes the program to stop near the point at which the 
variable was accessed. This feature helps you locate data 
modifications or accesses that may be incorrect. Refer to the section 
"Working with Watchpoints," in
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger,"
for more information about watchpoints. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_20.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-20 Data/Object window Watch menu 

<h4>Set Watchpoint</h4>
Sets a data watchpoint on the selected variable. The debugger 
displays a <b>Set Watchpoint</b> dialog box. This dialog box allows you 
to choose whether to trigger the watchpoint on a read access or on a 
write access. When executing a <b>Go</b> command, the debugger stops 
execution of the program as soon as the program accesses the 
specified variable. 
<p>

Dragging and dropping from the Data/Object window to the 
Watchpoint window also executes this command. 


<h4>Clear Watchpoint</h4>
Clears a watchpoint set on a selected variable. This command 
reverses the effect of the <b>Set Watchpoint</b> command. 


<h4>Clear All Watchpoints</h4>
Clear all watchpoints set in the program. 


<h3>ShowAs Menu</h3>

<b>ShowAs</b> menu commands let you change the data type that a 
variable is displayed as. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_21.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-21 Data/Object window ShowAs menu 

<h4>Show as Original Type</h4>
Displays a variable using its actual type after it has been typecast to 
another type. Executing <b>Show Value in Hex</b> on an already cast 
variable has the same effect. 


<h4>Show Value in Hex</h4>
Toggles the view between the originally declared type of the 
variable and its hexadecimal display. 


<h4>Show Value with Type</h4>
Changes a variable from its original type to another named type. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
The / symbol to the left of the variable name 
indicates that the variable is cast to a different type. 
<p>

When executing <b>Show Value with Type</b>, the debugger prompts you 
to enter the type name. If the type entered is not a predefined type, 
the debugger prompts you to enter the module in which that type is 
defined. The selected variable is then cast to that type. To reset the 
variable to its original type, choose <b>Show as Original Type</b>. 


<h4>Show Pointer as Array</h4>
Displays the data pointed to as an array. This command allows you 
to browse dynamically allocated arrays by displaying the data 
pointed to as an array. 


<h4>Examine String Pointer</h4>
Displays the string that the selected character pointer points to in a 
message box. To view the string, select the pointer and execute this 
command. 


<h4>Show Char Ptrs as Strings</h4>
Updates the Data/Object window to display the character strings to 
which character pointers point. 


<h4>Modify!</h4>

Modifies the contents of the selected variable or field. Select the 
variable or field you want to modify in the Data/Object window, 
then execute this command. The debugger prompts you to enter an 
expression to modify the variable. 
<p>

The expression must evaluate to a value of the same size as the 
variable, but not necessarily to the same type. Refer to Appendix A, 
"Expression Evaluation," for more information. 


<h4>Inspect!</h4>

Creates a new line for the selected variable in the Inspector window. 
Dragging and dropping a variable from the Data/Object window to 
the Inspector window has the same effect. 


<h4>New!</h4>

Creates a new, empty Data/Object window. 


<h3>Pop-up menu</h3>

The Data/Object window pop-up menu provides quick access to 
frequently used menu choices in the Data/Object window local 
menu. The <b>View</b>, <b>Show</b>, <b>ShowAs</b>, <b>Breakpoint</b>, and <b>Watch</b> 
commands access submenus that have some of the commands 
available from the similarly named menus on the Data/Object 
window menu bar. The <b>Modify</b> and <b>Inspect</b> commands function 
the same way as do the similarly named commands in the local 
menu.

<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="function"><h2>The Function Window</h2></a>

The Function window, shown in Figure 24-23, displays the functions 
in your program, the names of the modules in which they are 
defined, their addresses, and their memory model type (near or far— 
applicable only in 16-bit programs). Commands let you find 
functions and modules, set breakpoints on functions, and examine 
the local and global data of any function in the program. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_23.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-23 Function window 
	<p>

The Function window shows information for one function per line. 
The first column contains the breakpoint indicator. If a breakpoint 
has been set on or in the function, the first column contains a solid 
black diamond. If execution has stopped at a breakpoint in the 
function, the first column contains the outline of a diamond with a 
line through it. 
<p>


The next column contains the execution indicator. If the program 
has executed into the function, the column contains a right arrow. 
<p>


Next is the name of the function, followed by the name of the 
module in which the function is defined, the address of the function, 
and— if a 16-bit program is being debugged— the memory model 
type (near or far). 
<p>


The Function window has four local menus: <b>Find</b>, <b>Show</b>, <b>Bpt</b>, and 
<b>View</b>, listed in Table 24-6.

The menu items in the Function window are described below. 


<h3>Find menu</h3>

<b>Find</b> menu commands locate functions and modules in the Function 
window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_24.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-24 Function window Find menu 

<h4>Function</h4>
Locates a specific function in the Function window. When the 
command is executed, the debugger prompts you to enter the name 
of the function you want to find. The standard wildcards (* and ?) 
are supported in the name specification; case is significant. If the 
function is found, its entry is selected. 


<h4>Module</h4>
Searches for a module in the Function window. When the command 
is executed, the debugger prompts you to enter the name of the 
module you want to find. The standard wildcards (* and ?) are 
supported in the name specification. This command is not case 
sensitive. If the module is found, its entry is selected. 


<h4>Next</h4>
Repeats the last search executed, using a <b>Find</b> command. 


<h3>Show menu</h3>

The Show menu contains commands that update the Source, Data, 
and Assembly windows for any function in the Function window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_25.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-25 Function window Show menu 

<h4>Source</h4>
Updates the Source window and displays the selected function's 
source code. It is used to view the source code of any function in the 
program. If the debugger cannot locate the source file, a dialog box 
prompts you to enter its filename (including a path, if necessary). 
Dragging and dropping from the Function window to the Source 
window also executes this command. 


<h4>Local Data</h4>
Updates the Data/Object window and displays the selected 
function's local data. If the selected function is not found in the call 
chain (and therefore cannot have any local data), the debugger 
displays an error message. Dragging and dropping from the Function 
window to the Data/Object window also executes this command. 


<h4>Global Data</h4>
Updates the Data/Object window and shows the global data 
declared in the selected function's module. Dragging and dropping a 
module from the Project window to the Data/Object window also 
executes this command. 


<h4>Assembly</h4>
Updates the Assembly window to the code address of the function. 
Dragging and dropping from the Function window to the Assembly 
window also executes this command. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
You can drag and drop from the Function window 
to the Memory window to show the starting address 
in which the code for the selected function resides. 


<h4>All</h4>
Updates the Source, Data, and Assembly windows. You can also 
execute this command by double-clicking on a function entry. 


<h3>Bpt menu</h3>

The <b>Bpt</b> menu contains commands to set and clear breakpoints in 
the Function window. Refer to
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger,"
for details on the types of breakpoints 
that can be set. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_26.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-26 Function window Bpt menu 

<h4>Set/Clear Breakpoint</h4>
Sets an unconditional breakpoint at the entry point of the selected 
function. The next time any <b>Go</b> command is executed (except for 
the <b>Go until End</b> command), execution of the program stops when 
it reaches this line. If a breakpoint is already set on the selected 
function, this command clears it. 
<p>

Dragging and dropping from the Function window to the Breakpoint 
window also executes this command. 


<h4>Set Conditional Breakpoint</h4>
Displays the <b>Set Code Breakpoint</b> dialog box, which you use to set 
a conditional breakpoint at the entry point of the selected function. 


<h4>Clear All Breakpoints</h4>
Clears all breakpoints set in your program. 


<h4>Set On All Functions</h4>
Sets breakpoints on all functions currently being viewed in the 
Function window. 


<h4>Clear From All Functions</h4>
Clears any breakpoints set in the Function window. 


<h3>View menu</h3>

The <b>View</b> menu contains commands for functions that you choose to 
include in the Function window. A checkmark indicates the currently

<a name="graphicdata"><h2>The Graphic Data Window</h2></a>

The Graphic Data window, shown in Figure 24-29, is a sophisticated 
tool that lets you display a graph of a simple or complex data 
structure. The structure can be referenced by any variable defined in 
your program. The menu commands in the Graphic Data window let 
you view information and zoom in on specific parts of the graph. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_29.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-29 Graphic Data window 
	<p>

Data structures are displayed as boxes connected by lines or arrows. 
Each box represents a particular data object, each line a relationship 
between data objects, and each arrow a pointer relationship between 
data objects. 
<p>


Data objects are items in the structure that can have either a value or 
a meaning. Any of the following variables can be data objects: 
simple types, pointers, arrays, structures, or objects (class instances). 
<p>


To display a graph, select a variable in the Data/Object window and 
choose the <b>Graphic Data Structure</b> command from the <b>Show</b> 
menu. This variable becomes the starting (or root) data object of the 
graph. When you open the Graphic Data window, the root data 
object is displayed. 
<p>


The graph generated from the root data object can be either simple 
or complex. Simple graphs are created when the form of the 
structure is a singly linked list. Complex graphs are created when the 
form of the structure is a tree (with multiple pointers of the same 
type). If the graph cannot be displayed as a simple graph, it is 
displayed as a complex graph. 


<h3>Simple graphs</h3>

Simple graphs (and simple portions of graphs) can be fully displayed 
in the Graphic Data window. An overview of the entire graph is 
visible after it is created. You can zoom in and scroll through the 
graph to examine the information in more detail. A simple graph 
may contain nodes that hide subgraphs, as in the case of a node 
representing a tree with multiple pointers of the same type. Use the 
<b>Show Subgraph</b> command— that is, the <b>Subgraph</b> command in the 
<b>Show</b> menu— to view the subgraph. 


<h3>Complex graphs</h3>

Complex graphs are displayed initially in the Graphic Data window 
as a box representing the root data object of a subgraph. An object 
represents a complex subgraph when the variable name in the box is 
surrounded by vertical bars. To view the subgraph of a complex 
graph object, choose the <b>Show Subgraph</b> command. 
<p>


When viewing a complex subgraph, each object in the complex 
structure is displayed. You can zoom in and scroll through the graph 
to examine the information more closely. 
<p>


If you are viewing a complex subgraph and want to view its parent 
graph, choose the <b>Show Parent</b> command. 
<p>


Creating a graph might take a few seconds, depending on the speed 
of your machine, the amount of memory available, and the 
complexity of the data structure. The menu commands of the 
Graphic Data window are not available until a graph is displayed in 
the Graphic Data window. 
<p>


Each object in the graph displays information about itself, such as its 
name or value. To obtain more information about an object, use the 
<b>Show Information</b> command. Note that if an object is too small to 
display its information, you must zoom in on it before the 
information is displayed. 
<p>


The Graphic Data window has three local menus: <b>Show</b>, <b>Zoom</b>, and 
<b>Others</b>. 

<pre>

<b>Note:</b> 
To use the following commands on a particular 
object, first click on the object, then execute the 
command. 


<h4>Information</h4>
Displays in a message box the object name and its type information 
or value for the selected object. Select the object by clicking on it. 


<h4>Subgraph</h4>
Causes the Graphic Data window to display the associated subgraph 
of the object when a complex subgraph object is selected. 


<h4>Parent</h4>
Displays the parent graph of the current subgraph. When viewing a 
complex subgraph, this command lets you return to the parent 
graph. 


<h3>Zoom menu</h3>

<b>Zoom</b> menu commands control the view magnification of the 
selected object. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_31.gif">

then execute the command. The window redraws, enlarging the 
selected object. Double-clicking on an object also zooms in. 


<h4>Zoom Out</h4>
Zooms out from the selected object. Select the object by clicking on 
it, then execute this command. You can also double-click the right 
mouse button on an object to zoom out. 


<h4>Zoom Reset</h4>
Resets the display of the graph to its initial state. Use this command 
if you have zoomed or scrolled the display of the graph and want to 
restore the graph to its original state. 


<h3>Others</h3>

The <b>Others</b> menu contains the <b>Clear Graph</b> command. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_32.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-32 Graphic Data window Others menu 

<h4>Clear Graph</h4>
Clears the current graph from the Graphic Data window. In addition, 
this command frees the memory used by the graphical 
representation of the current data structure you are viewing. If the 
debugger is running low on memory, this command frees up the 
memory used by the Graphic Data window. 



<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="inspector"><h2>The Inspector Window</h2></a>

The Inspector window, shown in Figure 24-33, is similar in function 
to the Data/Object window, allowing you to display and modify 
variables and objects. Unlike the Data/Object window, it can display 
any mix of local and global variables. It can also display the same 
variable more than once, a useful feature if you want to view the 
same variable in different ways— for example, in hexadecimal, as an 
int, and as a pointer— all at the same time. With the Inspector 
window you can select several local variables from a function, or 
several global variables, and view them all simultaneously. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_33.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-33 Inspector window 
	<p>

Initially the Inspector window is empty. You add variables to it by 
dragging them from the Data/Object window, or by selecting a 
variable in the Data/Object window. then selecting <b>Inspect!</b> from 
the Data/Object window's local menu. You can also add multiple 
instances of the same variable to the Inspector window. To delete an 
instance of a variable from the Inspector window, select <b>Delete!</b> 
from the Inspector window's menu.

</pre>

The menu items in the Inspector window are described in the next 
section. 


<h3>Find Menu</h3>

Commands in the <b>Find</b> menu let you search for all instances of a 
variable in the Inspector window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_34.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-34 Inspector window Find menu 


<h4>Entry</h4>
Displays a dialog box that allows you to enter the name of a variable 
to find. Enter the name of the variable (or field) for which you want 
to search, and press Enter. The standard wildcards (* and ?) are 
supported in the name specification; case is significant. The 
debugger searches in the current scope for the variable and selects 
that line in the Inspector window. If there is more than one local 
variable with the same name, continue the search by using <b>Next</b>. 


<h4>Next</h4>
Repeats the last search executed using a <b>Find</b> command. 


<h3>View Menu</h3>

Commands in the <b>View</b> menu let you navigate within data structures 
and arrays. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_35.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-35 Inspector window View menu 

<h4>Child/Contents</h4>
Displays the level of the data structure one level down from the 
selected data structure. This command lets you navigate down 
through arrays, structures, and pointers to view their elements. You 
can also double-click on a data item to execute the <b>Child/Contents</b> 
command on it. This command operates in the following manner: 

<ul>
	<li> If the selected item is an array, the Inspector window 
	displays the list of elements of the array, one element per 
	line. The name of each element is its index value in the 
	array. You can examine and modify an array element just 
	as you would any other variable. 

	<li> If the selected item is an instance of a class, the Inspector 
	window displays its data members and their values. 

	<li> If the selected item is a record or structure, the Inspector 
	window displays the names and values of the structure 
	elements. 

	<li> If the selected item is a pointer, the Inspector window 
	displays the object it points to. 

	<li> If the selected item is a function, module, or method, the 
	Inspector window displays the message: 

	<pre>
	This data is not structured 
	</pre>

	<li> If the selected item is a nested block, the Inspector 
	window displays the variables declared in the nested 
	local scope. 
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> 
For faster compilation, Digital Mars C++ can optionally 
compile C++ modules without class debugging 
information. However, you cannot view objects or 
structures in such modules unless you recompile 
with class debugging information. 


<h4>Parent</h4>
Displays the parent data structure of the current data structure. This 
command lets you move up a level in a data structure that you 
previously moved down in with the <b>Child/Contents</b> command. 
When the <b>Parent</b> command is executed, the Inspector window 
displays the structure one level up from the current data structure. 


<h4>Right (Next Element)</h4>
Displays the next index of the current array. If you used the 
<b>Child/Contents</b> command to view the elements of an array, use the 
<b>Right (Next Element)</b> command to quickly select the next index in 
the array. 


<h4>Left (Prev. Element)</h4>
Displays the previous index of the current array. If you used the 
<b>Child/Contents</b> command to view the elements of an array, use this 
command to quickly select the previous index in the array. 


<h4>Specific Index</h4>
Specifies a particular index to view in the array. If you used the 
<b>Child/Contents</b> command to view the elements of an array, use this 
command to quickly view the contents of a specific index in the 
array. 
<p>

When this command is executed, the debugger prompts you to enter 
an expression to be evaluated. The result of the evaluation becomes 
the index of the newly displayed array element. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
Use any one of the commands <b>Right (Next 
Element)</b>, <b>Left (Prev. Element)</b>, or <b>Specific 
Index</b> when you are viewing the fields of an array 
element. The Inspector window displays the fields 
of the array with the new index. 
<p>

For example, if there is an array of records and the 
record fields of the first element of the array are 
displayed, use the <b>Right (Next Element)</b> command 
to directly view the record fields of the second 
element of the array. This is faster than executing 
the <b>Parent</b> command, changing the selection to the 
next index, and executing the <b>Child/Contents</b> 
command. 


<h4>Variable Level</h4>
Returns to the top nesting level (the variable level) of the data 
display. Use this command if you chose the <b>Child/Contents</b> 
command to descend into a data structure and want to return to the 
top variable level without repeatedly using the <b>Parent</b> command. 


<h3>Show Menu</h3>

The Show menu is used to update the Graphic Data Memory and 
Source windows to reflect the selected item in the Inspector 
window. It is also used to display the location of an address or a 
CPU register of the currently selected item. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_36.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-36 Inspector window Show menu 

<h4>Graphic Data Structure</h4>
Displays a graphic data representation of the selected variable. A 
drawing of the selected data structure is displayed in the Graphic 
Data window. This command provides a visual overview of your 
structure in addition to the data browsing capabilities provided by 
the Inspector window. For information about the Graphic Data 
display, see the section "The Graphic Data Window" later in this 
chapter. 
<p>

Dragging and dropping from the Inspector window to the Graphic 
Data window also executes this command. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
The <b>Graphic Data Structure</b> command is disabled 
if there are not enough Windows resources 
available to generate a view for the Graphic Data 
window. 


<h4>Memory</h4>
Updates the Memory window to display the memory location of the 
variable selected in the Inspector window. Dragging and dropping 
from the Inspector window to the Memory window also executes 
this command. 


<h4>Source of Method</h4>
Updates the Source window to the location of the code for the 
method highlighted in the Inspector window. 


<h4>Address</h4>
Displays in a message box the memory location of the variable on 
the selected line. If the variable is a register variable, this command 
displays the register( s) it is contained in on the status line. 


<h3>ShowAs Menu</h3>

The commands in this menu change the way the Inspector window 
displays variables. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_37.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-37 Inspector window ShowAs menu 

<h4>Show Pointer as Array </h4>
Displays the data pointed to by the variable on the selected line as 
an array. This command allows you to browse dynamically allocated 
arrays by displaying the data pointed to as an array. 


<h4>Show Value in Hex</h4>
Changes to hexadecimal the display type of a variable on the 
selected line. The command toggles the view between the originally 
declared type of the variable and its hexadecimal display. If the 
Inspector window displays the same variable more than once, only 
one instance of this variable is affected. 


<h4>Show Value with Type</h4>
Changes a variable from its original type to another named type. If 
the Inspector window displays the same variable more than once, 
only the selected instance of this variable is affected. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
The / symbol to the left of the variable name 
indicates that the variable is cast to a different type. 
<p>

When executing <b>Show Value with Type</b>, the debugger prompts you 
to enter the type name. The variable on the selected line is then cast 
to that type. To reset the variable to its original type, choose <b>Show 
as Original Type</b> from the <b>ShowAs</b> menu. 


<h4>Show as Original Type</h4>
Displays a variable using its actual type after it has been typecast to 
another type. Executing <b>Show Value in Hex</b> on an already cast 
variable has the same effect. 


<h4>Examine String Pointer</h4>
Displays the string that the selected character pointer points to in a 
message box. To view the string, select a line with a pointer variable 
and execute this command. 


<h4>Show Char Ptrs as Strings </h4>
Updates the Inspector window to display the character strings to 
which the character pointers point. 


<h3>Watch menu</h3>

Commands in the <b>Watch</b> menu are used to control data watchpoints 
in the program. When a watchpoint is set on a variable, a change in 
the variable's value or in the implementation of a read access to the 
variable causes the program to stop near the point at which the 
variable was accessed. This feature helps locate data modifications or 
accesses that may be incorrect. Refer to
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger,"
for more information about watchpoints. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_38.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-38 Inspector window Watch menu 

<h4>Set Watchpoint</h4>
Sets a data watchpoint on the selected variable and causes the 
debugger to display a <b>Set Watchpoint</b> dialog box. This dialog box 
allows you choose whether to trigger the watchpoint on a read 
access or on a write access. When executing a <b>Go</b> command, the 
debugger stops execution of the program as soon as the program 
accesses the specified variable. 
<p>

Dragging and dropping from the Inspector window to the 
Watchpoint window also executes this command. 


<h4>Clear Watchpoint</h4>
Clears a watchpoint set on a selected variable. This command 
reverses the effect of the <b>Set Watchpoint</b> command. 


<h4>Clear All Watchpoints</h4>
Clears all watchpoints set in the program. 


<h3>Modify!</h3>

Modifies the contents of the selected variable or field. First select the 
variable or field you want to modify in the Inspector window before 
executing the command. The debugger prompts you to enter an 
expression to modify the variable. 
<p>

The expression must evaluate to a value of the same size as the 
variable, but not necessarily of the same type. Refer to Appendix A, 
"Expression Evaluation," for more information. 


<h3>Delete!</h3>

Deletes the selected line. If the variable or object that is displayed on 
this line is also displayed on other lines in the Inspector window, 
these lines are not affected. 


<h3>Pop-up menu</h3>

The Inspector window pop-up menu provides quick access to 
frequently used menu choices in the Inspector window local menu. 
The <b>View</b>, <b>Show</b>, <b>ShowAs</b>, and <b>Watch</b> commands access submenus 
that have some of the commands that are available from the similarly 
named menus on the Inspector window menu bar. The <b>Modify</b> and 
<b>Delete</b> commands function the same way as do the similarly named 
commands in the local menu.

<a name="memory"><h2>The Memory Window</h2></a>

The Memory window, shown in Figure 24-40, displays the memory 
contents of a given address in different formats. Memory window 
commands modify a memory location, set memory watchpoints, and 
set the memory address to view. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_40.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-40 The Memory window 
	<p>

The Memory window shows the contents of a range of memory 
addresses. You can display memory in 11 different formats, ranging 
from hexadecimal bytes to real numbers. To display memory, either 
specify a particular address to view or view the address of a variable 
by using the Data/Object window's <b>Show Memory</b> command. 
<p>

In addition to examining a particular address, you can scroll through 
the Memory window to view all the memory in a segment. In 32-bit 
flat memory, you can scroll through your application's entire address 
space. You may not have access to certain memory areas that are 
restricted to your application. In that case, the memory contents are 
displayed as Xs. You can modify memory and set memory 
watchpoints as well. 
<p>

The Memory window in the debugger has three local menus: 
<b>View</b>, <b>Watch</b>, and <b>Others</b>.

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_41.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-41 Memory window View menu 

<h4>Character</h4>
Sets the display format to character. The contents of memory are 
displayed as ASCII characters enclosed in single quotes. If an address 
does not contain a standard U. S. ASCII character, the octal value of 
the character is displayed. 


<h4>Text</h4>
Sets the display format to complete text. The contents of memory are 
displayed as characters in the PC's code page. Each memory value is 
displayed as a single character. The complete extended character set 
is used to display the text. Values that cannot be displayed are 
represented by dots. 


<h4>Byte</h4>
Sets the display format to hexadecimal bytes. The contents of 
memory are displayed as 2-digit hexadecimal values. 


<h4>Word</h4>
Sets the display format to hexadecimal words. The contents of 
memory are displayed as 4-digit hexadecimal values. 


<h4>Unsigned</h4>
Sets the display format to unsigned integers. The contents of 
memory are displayed as 2-byte unsigned integers in the range of 0 
to 65535. 


<h4>Integer</h4>
Sets the display format to signed integers. The contents of memory 
are displayed as 2-byte signed integers in the range of -32768 to 
32767. 


<h4>Long Integer</h4>
Sets the display format to signed long integers. The contents of 
memory are displayed as 4-byte signed integers in the range of 
-2147483648 to 2147483647. 


<h4>Short Real</h4>
Sets the display format to short real numbers. The contents of 
memory are displayed as 4-byte, single-precision real numbers. The 
4-byte memory ranges that are not valid 4-byte reals are denoted by 
the phrase "not a real." 


<h4>Long Real</h4>
Sets the display format to extended real numbers. The contents of 
memory are displayed as 8-byte, double-precision real numbers. 


<h4>Extended Real</h4>
Sets the display format to long real numbers. The contents of 
memory are displayed as 10-byte, extended-precision real numbers. 


<h4>Address</h4>
Sets the display format to addresses. The contents of memory are 
displayed as addresses of the form segment: offset. If you are running 
in 32-bit flat memory space, the addresses are displayed as 8-digit 
hexadecimal numbers. 


<h3>Watch menu</h3>

The commands on the <b>Watch</b> menu control memory watchpoints in 
the program. After you set a watchpoint on a memory location, a 
write to or a read from that location causes the program to stop near 
the point where the access occurred. This feature allows you to catch 
memory modifications that may be incorrect. For more information 
about watchpoints, refer to
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_42.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-42 Memory window Watch menu 


<h4>Set Watchpoint</h4>
Sets a memory watchpoint on the selected memory location. 
Dragging and dropping from the Memory window to the Watchpoint 
window also executes this command. 


<h4>Clear Watchpoint</h4>
Clears a watchpoint set on the selected memory location, reversing 
the effect of the <b>Set Watchpoint</b> command on the location. 


<h4>Clear All Watchpoints</h4>
Clears all watchpoints set in the program. 


<h3>Others menu</h3>

Use the <b>Others</b> menu commands to modify data, to specify the 
direct memory address to display, to link the memory address to an 
expression, or to set the memory address through an address in 
memory. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_43.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-43 Memory window Others menu 


<h4>Modify</h4>
Displays an <b>Expression</b> dialog box modifying the contents of the 
selected memory location. 


<h4>Set Memory Address</h4>
Updates the Memory window to the address specified. When a 
debugger dialog box prompts you for an address, enter the 
hexadecimal address. 
<p>

Type the address in the form 0Xnnnn:0Xnnnn to specify a 16-bit 
segment:offset pair; type the address in the form 0Xnnnnnnnn, 
where nnnnnnnn is an 8-digit hexadecimal number, to specify a 32-bit 
address. For 16-bit code, to view another offset in the same 
segment ac is currently displayed, enter only the offsed location. The 
Memory window then displays the contents of memory at the new 
location. 


<h4>Set Live Memory Expression</h4>
Links the address displayed in the Memory window to an expression 
(such as CS:IP or SS:SP) and causes the debugger to display an 
<b>Expression</b> dialog box. Each time control returns to the debugger 
after a <b>Go</b> command, the expression is evaluated and the result is 
used to update the memory location to display. 


<h4>Show Child</h4>
Sets the Memory window display address to the location contained 
in the currently selected Memory window location. (The Memory 
window must be displaying memory in the Address format.) 


<h3>Pop-up menu</h3>

The Memory window pop-up menu provides quick access to 
frequently used menu choices in the Memory window local menu.

<a name="output"><h2>The Output Window</h2></a>

The Output window is used to display the messages generated by 
the compiler, the linker, and the IDDE. For example, errors and 
warnings generated by the compiler when it builds your code are 
displayed in the Output window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_45.gif">

<h3>Stop!</h3>

Choosing this menu causes the IDDE to stop a build or a parse 
operation running in the background. 


<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="project"><h2>The Project Window</h2></a>

The Project window, displays in its left pane the names of the project 
and any subprojects that form your program; in its right pane it 
shows the source and object modules that comprise the project or 
subproject selected on the left. Entries in the right pane can be 
sorted along any of the columns displayed in that pane by clicking 
on the column title; the title of the column along which entries are 
sorted is shown in boldface. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_47.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-47 Project window 
	<p>

Two columns in the right pane contain meaningful information only 
when the IDDE is in debugging mode; otherwise they display N/A. 
The EXE/DLL column indicates the executable to which a module 
belongs. The Virtual column indicates whether or not a module 
whose debug information has been loaded has not had its code 
loaded. You can set breakpoints for such a module; however, you 
cannot set watchpoints because the module's data has not yet been 
loaded. 
<p>

The icon to the left of each entry in the Project window's right pane 
contains status information about the module or file: 

<ul>
	<li> The black bug symbol in the left part of the icon (it may 
	look like * on some monitors) signifies that this module 
	is compiled with debugging information. 

	<li> The small black T in the right part of the icon signifies 
	that tracing into this module is enabled. 

	<li> The dot in the lower part of the icon signifies that a 
	breakpoint has been set in the module. If the dot is 
	green, the breakpoint is enabled; if the dot is red, the 
	breakpoint is disabled. 
</ul>

When the right pane is sorted according to name, the module entries 
in the Project window are listed in alphabetical order by extension 
within directories, with the executable name to the right. 
<p>

The Project window in the debugger has four local menus: <b>Parse</b>, 
<b>View</b>, <b>Trace</b>, and <b>VCS</b> (shown in Table 24-11).

The menu items in the Project window are described below. 


<h3>Parse menu</h3>

The <b>Parse</b> menu is not used during debugging. For more 
information about the commands on this menu, see
Chapter 15, "More about Projects and Workspaces." 


<h3>View menu</h3>

The <b>View</b> menu updates the Source and Data/Object windows to 
display the source code and global data of the selected module. It is 
also used to update the Assembly window to show the assembly 
code of the module, to update the Function window to show the 
functions in the module, and to display the starting code address of 
the module. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_48.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-48 Project window View menu 
	<p>

The commands in this menu are grayed out unless the selected file 
contains code. For example, they are grayed out for header files, 
 .def files, and .res files. 


<h4>Source</h4>
Updates the Source window to show the source code of the selected 
module. If the debugger cannot locate the source file, a dialog box 
prompts you to enter the path of the source file. Dragging and 
dropping from the Project window to the Source window also 
executes this command. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
To search for source files in different directories, 
include those directories in the DPATH environment 
variable. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_49.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-49 Project window View menu 

<h4>Global Data</h4>
Updates the Data/Object window to show the global variables in the 
selected module. Use this command to view the global data of any 
module in the program. Dragging and dropping from the Project 
window to the Data/Object window also executes this command. 


<h4>Functions</h4>
Updates the Function window to show the functions in the selected 
module. Dragging and dropping from the Project window to the 
Function window also executes this command. 


<h4>Assembly</h4>
Updates the Assembly window to the starting code address of the 
module. Dragging and dropping from the Project window to the 
Assembly window also executes this command. 


<h4>All</h4>
Updates the Source, Data, Function, and Assembly windows. 
Double-clicking on a module entry also executes this command. 


<h4>Code Address</h4>
Displays a dialog box showing the code address of the first 
statement in a module. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
Dragging and dropping from the Project window to 
the Memory window displays memory starting from 
the code address of the selected entry in the Project 
window. 


<h3>Trace menu</h3>

Sometimes you don't want to trace into a particular module or set of 
modules. The <b>Trace</b> menu contains commands that control whether 
the debugger can step into, set breakpoints in, or watch data in a 
particular module. By default, all modules in a program have tracing 
enabled. 
<p>

While stepping through a program using the <b>Go</b> menu commands, 
the debugger does not stop the program in modules that have 
tracing disabled. To prevent stepping into a particular module, 
disable tracing for that module. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_50.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-50 Project window Trace menu 

<h4>Enable</h4>
Enables tracing in the selected module. 


<h4>Disable</h4>
Disables tracing in the selected module. 


<h4>Enable All</h4>
Enables tracing in all program modules. 


<h4>Disable All</h4>
Disables tracing in all program modules. 


<h3>VCS menu</h3>

This menu is used to control the version control system and is not 
used during debugging. See
Chapter 22, "Using Version Control," for more information. 


<h3>Pop-up menus</h3>

The Project window provides a pop-up menu for each of its two 
panes. They are accessible by clicking on the left or the right side of 
the Project window. Most of the commands in these menus are 
generally not used during debugging. They are documented in detail 
in Chapter 15, "More about Projects and Workspaces." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_51.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-51 Project window pop-up menu 
	<p>

There are three items in the <b>Don't Show</b> submenu: <b>Modules</b>, 
<b>Parsed</b>, and <b>Dependencies</b>. When <b>Modules</b> is checked, the right 
pane excludes files explicitly added to the project. Checking <b>Parsed</b> 
excludes files added to the project only as a result of parsing. 
Checking <b>Dependencies</b> excludes files added to the project only as 
a result of building the project. 




<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="register"><h2>The Register Window</h2></a>

The Register window, shown in Figure 24-52, displays the CPU 
register values of the processor. If a math coprocessor is installed in 
the system, or if the CPU has a built-in floating-point unit (FPU), 
those floating-point register values are displayed as well. Commands 
are provided for changing the contents and the display mode of the 
registers. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_52.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-52 Register window 
	<p>

The Register window displays the registers either horizontally or 
vertically, and in either hexadecimal or decimal format. Select a 
specific register by clicking on it or by using the arrow keys. The 
Register window has two local menus, <b>View</b> and <b>Others</b>, listed in 
Table 24-12.

<h3>View menu</h3>

The <b>View</b> menu contains commands that switch the display mode of 
the registers between hexadecimal and decimal, and the display 
orientation between horizontal and vertical. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_53.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-53 Register window View menu 

<h4>Hex</h4>
Sets the register display mode to hexadecimal. After this command is 
executed, register values are displayed as hexadecimal words. HEX is 
displayed in the status line. 


<h4>Decimal</h4>
Sets the register display mode to decimal. After it is executed, 
register values are displayed as unsigned integers. DEC is displayed 
in the status line. 


<h4>Vertical/Horizontal</h4>
Toggles the register orientation between vertical and horizontal. The 
chosen orientation persists from one session to the next. 


<h3>Others menu</h3>

The <b>Others</b> menu commands modify the selected register. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_54.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-54 Register window Others menu 

<h4>Modify</h4>
Opens the <b>Expression</b> dialog box to modify the selected register. 


<h4>Out Byte to Port</h4>
Prompts for the I/O port number and a byte value. After you press 
Enter, the debugger executes an OUT instruction to the specified 
port. 


<h4>Out Word to Port</h4>
Prompts you for I/O port number and a word value. After you press 
Enter, the debugger executes an OUT instruction to the specified 
port. 


<h4>In Byte from Port</h4>
This command prompts you for the I/O port number and a byte 
value. After you press Enter, the debugger executes an IN 
instruction to the specified port. 


<h4>In Word from Port</h4>
Prompts for the I/O port number and a word value. After you press 
Enter, the debugger executes an IN instruction to the specified port. 


<h3>Pop-up menu</h3>

The pop-up menu of the Registers window contains the <b>Modify</b> 
command, described above in the <b>Others</b> menu. 


<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="source"><h2>The Source Window</h2></a>

The Source window, shown in Figure 24-55, displays the source 
code of a program. When you start debugging, the Source window 
changes from an editing to a debugging window. 
<p>

In debugging mode, you can view or change the current execution 
position, manipulate source-level breakpoints, and set the Assembly 
window view to a particular source line in a Source window. See 
Chapter 6, "Editing Program Code," for information on editing in a 
Source window. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_55.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-55 Source window 
	<p>

Use any of the following methods to view the source file of a 
particular module: 

<ul>
	<li> Use the <b>View Source</b> command in the Project window. 

	<li> Select the <b>Open</b> command from the IDDE's <b>File</b> menu to 
	view a module. 

	<li> Drag and drop the module from the Project window to 
	an open Source window, or to the desktop, to open a 
	new Source window. 

	<li> Double-click on the module in the Project window. 
</ul>

The location of the selection line in the Source window also 
determines the current local scope for evaluation of local variables in 
the expression evaluator. Refer to Appendix A, "Expression 
Evaluation," for more information. 
<p>

Several different status messages can appear in the Source window. 
If the source file cannot be found, the window displays the following 
message: 

<pre>
	Source file not found 
</pre>

If there is insufficient debug information in the module, the Source 
window displays the following message: 

<pre>
	No source associated 
</pre>

In debugging mode, the left margin of the Source window expands 
to a vertically bordered pane two columns wide that contains the 
breakpoint and execution indicators. If a breakpoint has been set on 
a particular line, the first column of the margin contains a flag 
(displayed as a circle on some systems) in the same row as the line 
on which the breakpoint has been set. 
<p>

If a line contains a function call that has not yet returned, the second 
column contains an arrow. If execution has stopped at a breakpoint 
in the program, the line with the breakpoint is similarly marked with 
an arrow. Because it is the current line, it is also highlighted. (Refer 
to "Working with Breakpoints," in
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger,"
for more information about 
breakpoints.) 
<p>

The Source window has five local menus: <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Goto</b>, <b>Macro</b>, 
and <b>New!</b>. The commands in the <b>Macro</b> menu also can be useful 
during debugging, because some Source window debugging 
commands can be recorded, edited, and played back. See Digital Mars 
C++ IDDE Help for more information on the Digital Mars BASIC 
scripting language. Some <b>Goto</b> commands also can be useful during 
the debugging session. The other menus contain commands that are 
generally applicable to editing. These are discussed in detail in 
Chapter 21, "Text Editor Reference." 


<h3>Pop-up menu</h3>

The pop-up menu contains commands for executing the following: 
setting and clearing breakpoints, changing execution location, 
showing the code address of the current selection, updating the 
Assembly, Function, Memory, and Data/Object windows, and 
looking up the current value of a variable and locating the source for 
a particular number. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_56.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-56 Source window debugging mode pop-up menu 
	<p>

Commands in the Source window debugging mode pop-up menu 
are listed in Table 24-13. 

<pre>
	Table 24-13 Source window debugging mode pop-up menu 

	<b>Menu Item		Shortcut</b> 

	Set/Clear Breakpoint	none 
	Set Conditional Breakpoint none 
	Clear All Breakpoints	none 
	Go Until Line		none 
	Skip to Line		none 
	Show Assembly		none 
	Show Functions		none 
	Show Data		none 
	Show Memory		none 
	Show Code Address	none 
	Query Implementors	none 
	Query Value		none 
</pre>

These Source window pop-up menu items are described below. 


<h4>Set/Clear Breakpoint</h4>
Sets an unconditional breakpoint at the selected source line if no 
breakpoint is set on that line. The next time any <b>Go</b> command is 
executed (except for the <b>Go until End</b> command), execution of the 
program stops when it reaches that line. If a breakpoint is already set 
on the selected source line, this command clears it. 
<p>

Move a breakpoint by dragging the flag (circle) in the left 
side to a new line, signifying that a breakpoint has been set on this 
line. Clear a breakpoint by dragging the flag out of the 
Source window and dropping it on the desktop. 
<p>

You also can set an unconditional breakpoint by dragging a source 
line from the Source window to the Breakpoint window. It is 
possible to clear the breakpoint by dragging the source line it is set 
on into the Breakpoint window. You can perform these drag 
operations only if the Normal Selection for Debugging option on the 
Text page of the <b>Editing/Browsing Options</b> dialog box is 
unchecked. 


<h4>Set Conditional Breakpoint</h4>
Sets a conditional breakpoint at the entry of the selected function. 
This command displays the <b>Set Code Breakpoint</b> dialog box for 
specifying the condition of the breakpoint. (Refer to "Conditional 
and delayed breakpoints," in
Chapter 23, "Controlling and Configuring the Debugger,"
for more information about conditional 
breakpoints.) 


<h4>Clear All Breakpoints</h4>
Clears all breakpoints in the current module. 


<h4>Go until Line</h4>
Allows the program to run until execution reaches the current line, at 
which point execution halts and the debugger regains control. If the 
current line will not be executed again before the program 
terminates, this is equivalent to the <b>Go until End</b> command. 
Double-clicking on a line in the Source window also executes up to 
that line. 


<h4>Skip to Line</h4>
Changes the execution location to the address of the selected source 
line. After you execute the program again, it resumes execution from 
the new location. 
<p>

To use this command, select the source line on which you want 
execution to resume and choose <b>Skip to Line</b> from the pop-up 
menu. 
<p>

If there is more than one source-level statement on that line, the 
debugger uses the first statement on the line. 
<p>

After this command is executed, the code and instruction pointer 
registers are updated and the Source window shows the new 
execution location. This command simulates a jump instruction and 
lets you skip portions of code you don't want to execute. 


<h4>Show Assembly</h4>
Updates the Assembly window to the code address of the current 
selection. If more than one source-level statement is on that line, the 
debugger uses the first statement on the line. You also can do this by 
dragging and dropping from the Source window to the Assembly 
window if the Normal Selection for Debugging option on the Text 
page of the <b>Editing/Browsing Options</b> dialog box is disabled. 


<h4>Show Functions</h4>
Updates the Function window to show the functions in the current 
source module. You also can do this by dragging and dropping from 
the Source window to the Function window if the Normal Selection 
for Debugging option on the Text page of the <b>Editing/Browsing 
Options</b> dialog box is disabled. 


<h4>Show Data</h4>
Updates the Data/Object window to show the data objects in the 
current scope. Choose this command when you want to see the local 
variables in the scope of the current source line. You also can do this 
by dragging and dropping from the Source window to the Data/
Object window if the Normal Selection for Debugging option on the 
Text page of the <b>Editing/Browsing Options</b> dialog box is disabled. 


<h4>Show Memory</h4>
Updates the Memory window to display a range of memory, starting 
with the code address of the selected source line. You also can do 
this by dragging and dropping from the Source window to the 
Memory window if the Normal Selection for Debugging option on 
the Text page of the <b>Editing/Browsing Options</b> dialog box is 
disabled. 


<h4>Show Code Address</h4>
Displays the code address of the selected line. If more than one 
source-level statement is on that line, the command prompts you to 
enter the statement number of the address you want to view, such as 
1 or 2. If you don't enter a statement number, the debugger uses the 
first statement on the line. 


<h4>Query Implementors</h4>
Displays the Class Editor showing the implementation of the selected 
member. 


<h4>Query Value</h4>
Looks up the current value of the selected token and displays it on 
the status line. 


<h3>Toolbar</h3>

The Source window, when in debugging mode, has a debugging 
toolbar that provides easy access to common debugging commands. 
Refer to Figure 24-57 for the debugging toolbar icons. The function 
of these icons is described below, in order, from left to right.

pausing a message file. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_59.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-59 Spy window File menu 

<h4>Open</h4>
Opens a message log file in which window messages are logged. 
The command prompts you to enter a filename. The log file is 
created, and all subsequent messages appearing in the Spy window 
are written to that file until you close or pause logging to the file. 


<h4>Close</h4>
Closes a message log file so messages are no longer written to that 
file. To begin message logging again, open a file with the <b>Open</b> 
command. 


<h4>Pause</h4>
Acts as a toggle switch that pauses message output to the message 
log file. To continue message logging to the file, execute the <b>Pause</b> 
command again. This command is checked when logging to the file 
is paused. 


<h3>Show menu</h3>

The <b>Show</b> menu contains two commands, one to update the Source 
window to display the window procedure that handled a message, 
and the other to update the Memory window with the address 
specified by the lParam parameter of a message. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_60.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-60 Spy window Show menu 


<h4>Window Proc Source</h4>
Updates the Source window to the location of the window 
procedure to which the selected message was delivered. Dragging 
and dropping from the Spy window to the Source window also 
executes this command. 


<h4>lParam Memory</h4>
Uses the selected message's lParam parameter as an address and 
updates the Memory window to that address. The Memory window 
then displays the contents of the structure passed in the message. 
<p>

Dragging and dropping from the Spy window to the Memory 
window also executes this command. 


<h3>Bpt menu</h3>

<h4>Specify Windows</h4>
Specifies windows you want to spy on. A dialog box prompts you to 
select or deselect windows to spy on when you choose this 
command. If the specified window does not exist, the debugger 
watches for and activates message spying after its creation. 


<h4>Specify Messages</h4>
Specifies which messages you want to spy on. A dialog box opens, 
in which you select the messages. 


<h4>Post Message</h4>
Displays the <b>Post Message</b> dialog box, which allows you to post 
one or more messages to one or more windows. This dialog box lets 
you select a window handle and enter wParam and lParam values 
for the message. The Queue for Posting button places this message 
at the end of a queue that holds the messages you have specified. 
<p>

Once you have queued at least one message for posting, the Exit 
and Post button becomes enabled; clicking on it posts all the 
messages you have queued to their respective windows, in the order 
in which you queued them.

<a name="thread"><h2>The Thread Window (32-Bit IDDE Only)</h2></a>

The Thread window, shown in Figure 24-63, presents at a glance all 
the currently extant threads your program has created, together with 
their states. All 16-bit applications can have only one thread; 32-bit 
applications can be designed to have more than one thread. The 
Thread window provides no benefits when debugging a single-thread 
application. When debugging a 32-bit multithreaded 
application, you can use the Thread window to: 


<ul>
	<li> Switch easily between threads to debug 
	<li> Update the Source window with a thread's current 
	location 
	<li> Update the Data/Object window with a thread's data 
	<li> Update the Call window with a thread's call chain 
</ul>

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_63.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-63 Thread window 
	<p>

Current threads are listed one per row, with the currently selected 
thread highlighted. You can change the selection by clicking on a 
different row or by using the arrow keys. The primary thread is 
identified by a bold arrow in the left margin. This thread receives 
user input and is automatically created by the operating system 
when a process (an instance of an application) is created. The active 
thread— the one from which the debugger regained control— is 
identified by a normal arrow in the left margin. The columns of the 
Thread window have the following significance: 

<pre>
	Table 24-15 Thread window columns 

	<b>Column Title	Meaning</b> 

	id		Thread ID number. Thread IDs are unique 
			within a process. 
	stat		Status. Possible values of this field are: 
			Frz -the thread is "frozen" 
			(suspended) 
			Thw -the thread is "thawed" (resumed 
			or not suspended) 
	prty		Priority. 
	esp		Current top of stack for thread. 
	eip		Current instruction location for thread. 
</pre>

The Thread window has two local menus, <b>Show</b> and <b>Action</b>, as 
detailed in Table 24-16. 

<pre>
	Table 24-16 Thread window commands 

	<b>Menu	Menu Item	Shortcut</b>

	Action	Freeze		Ctrl+F 
		Thaw		Ctrl+T 
		Freeze Others	Ctrl+O 
		Thaw Others	Ctrl+M 
</pre>

<h3>Show menu</h3>

The <b>Show</b> menu contains commands for updating the Source 
window, Data/Object window, and Call window to reflect the state 
of the currently selected thread. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_64.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-64 Thread window Show menu 

<h4>Source</h4>
Updates the Source window to display the location of the selected 
thread. 


<h4>Data</h4>
Updates the Data/Object window to reflect the data of the selected 
thread. The local variables of the active functions in the thread are 
displayed with the values they have in the selected thread. Dragging 
and dropping from the Thread window to the Data/Object window 
also executes this command. 


<h4>Call Chain</h4>
Updates the Call window to display the call chain for the selected 
thread. Dragging and dropping from the Thread window to the Call 
window also executes this command. 


<h4>All</h4>
Updates the Source window, Data/Object window, and Call 
window. This command is equivalent to executing the above three 
commands at once. Double-clicking on any thread in the Thread 
window also executes this command. 



<h3>Action menu</h3>

The <b>Action</b> menu contains commands for setting the status of 
threads. 

<h4>Freeze</h4>
Freezes (suspends) the currently selected thread. 

<h4>Thaw</h4>
Unfreezes (resumes) the currently selected thread. 

<h4>Freeze Others</h4>
Freezes (suspends) all threads other than the active thread. 

<h4>Unfreeze Others</h4>
Unfreezes (resumes) all threads other than the active thread. 


<h3>Pop-up menu</h3>

The pop-up menu contains all the commands in the <b>Show</b> and 
<b>Action</b> menus, described above.

<a name="trace"><h2>The Trace Messages Window</h2></a>

The Trace Messages window, shown in Figure 24-71, is a simple 
scrolling window in which you can view debugging messages 
written by the debugging version of Windows, by MFC, and by your 
own program (using the MFC TRACE macros or the 
OutputDebugString Windows API). You can log all messages 
written to this window to a file (see the <b>Open Trace File</b> command 
below). 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
Because of differences in system level support for 
debugging, tracing does not begin in the Trace 
Messages window on Windows 95 or Windows NT 
until you start debugging and choose Go 
Breakpoint or Go End. On Windows 3.1, tracing 
begins when you start debugging. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_65.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-65 Trace Messages window 
	<p>

The top line of the Trace Messages window displays the destinations 
of messages. The possible messages are: 

<pre>
	Table 24-17 Trace Messages window message destinations 

	<b>Top Line		Meaning</b>

	No output		Messages are neither 
				written to the window 
				nor saved to the file. 

	Output to window only	Messages are written 
				to the window only. 

	Output to window, File:pathname		Messages go to both 
						the Trace Messages 
						window and to the 
						trace file. 
</pre>

The Trace Messages window has three local menus: <b>File</b>, <b>Options</b>, 
and <b>Clear!</b>, listed in Table 24-18. 

<pre>
	Table 24-18 Trace Window commands

		No Output		none 
	Clear!				none 
</pre>

Menu items in the Trace Messages window are described below. 


<h3>File Menu</h3>

<b>File</b> menu commands open a new trace file, close a trace file, and 
pause the output to the trace file. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_66.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-66 Trace Messages window File menu 

<h4>Open Trace File</h4>
Opens a trace file, to which the Trace Messages window output is 
saved. You are prompted to enter a filename. Provided you have 
chosen <b>Output to Window</b> in the <b>Options</b> menu (see below), the 
file is created and all subsequent Trace Messages window output is 
written to this file, until you close or pause trace output to the file. 


<h4>Close Trace File</h4>
Closes the trace file so that trace messages no longer are written to it. 
To begin logging output again, open a trace file using the <b>Open 
Trace File</b> command. 


<h4>Pause Trace File</h4>
Acts as a toggle to pause any Trace Messages window output to an 
open trace file. To resume logging output to the log file, choose the 
<b>Pause Trace File</b> command again. When output is paused, the 
menu option has a checkmark next to it. 


<h3>Options Menu</h3>

The <b>Options</b> menu commands let you specify the debug messages 
you want to display in the Trace window (and in the trace file, if you 
have one opened ). The commands also let you toggle the display of 
debug messages on and off. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
In the 32-bit IDDE, only the commands <b>Output to 
Window</b> and <b>No Output</b> are present in the 
<b>Options</b> menu.. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_67.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-67 Trace Messages window Options menu 

<h4>Windows Debug Messages</h4>
(Not in 32-bit IDDE) Displays the <b>Windows Trace Debug Options</b> 
dialog box, which lets you specify the categories of errors, warnings 
and debug messages that you want the debugging version of 
Windows to trap and notify you of.. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_68.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-68 Windows Trace Debug Options dialog box 
	<p>

The Break Options group lets you specify whether errors, warnings, 
or messages should cause a break to the debugger. Unless Break 
with INT 3 is checked, a stack trace is written to the Trace Messages 
window whenever the debugging version of Windows causes a 
break to the debugger. 
<p>

The Debug Options group lets you direct the debugging version of 
Windows to perform various operations that assist you in diagnosing 
problems. 
<p>

The Trace Options group lets you specify which informational 
messages are written to the Trace Messages window. 
<p>

The options chosen here are stored in the [Windows] section of 
win.ini. The Trace Options group corresponds to the 
DebugOptions entry in win.ini: each check box corresponds to 
a single bit of the hexadecimal number stored as the value of 
DebugOptions. The Break and Debug groups correspond to the 
FilterOptions entry in win.ini: here also, each check box 
corresponds to a single bit of the hexadecimal number stored as the 
value of FilterOptions. 
<p>

For further information on these options, see the documentation for 
the WINDEBUGINFO structure in Microsoft Windows Programmer's 
Reference, Volume 3. In particular, the bits of the fields dwOptions 
and dwFilter of WINDEBUGINFO correspond to the 
DebugOptions and FilterOptions entries in win. ini. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
If you choose this command and are not running 
the debug version of Windows, a message box 
informs you: 

<pre>
	This command requires installed 
	debugging Windows system binaries. 
</pre>

<h4>MFC Debug Messages</h4>
(Not in 32-bit IDDE) Displays the <b>MFC Trace Debug Options</b> 
dialog box. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_69.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-69 MFC Trace Debug Options dialog box 
	<p>

This dialog box lets you choose which MFC debug messages to 
capture. The options chosen here are stored in the 
[Diagnostics] section of the file afx. ini, located in the 
Windows directory. The Enable Tracing check box corresponds to 
the TraceEnabled entry in afx. ini. The remaining check boxes 
correspond as a group to the single entry TraceFlags in 
afx. ini, and each check box corresponds to a single bit of the 
hexadecimal number stored as the value of TraceFlags. 


<h4>OLE2 LRPC Spy</h4>
(Not in 32-bit IDDE) Enables monitoring of OLE Lightweight Remote 
Procedure Calls (LRPC), the mechanism by which OLE2 transports 
procedure calls across process boundaries from an OLE container to 
an OLE server or vice-versa. The command brings up the <b>OLE2 
LRPC Trace Debug Options</b> dialog box. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_70.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-70 OLE LRPC Trace Debug Options dialog box 

<h4>Output to Window</h4>
Displays debug messages in the window. If you have opened a trace 
file, you must choose this command for messages to be written to 
the file. Choosing this checks the item on the menu and unchecks 
<b>No Output</b>. 


<h4>No Output</h4>
Disables display of debug messages in the window. It prevents 
messages from being written to any opened trace file. Choosing this 
command checks the item on the menu and unchecks <b>Output to 
window</b>. 


<h3>Clear!</h3>

Removes all messages in the Trace window, but does not remove 
them from the trace file.

<hr><!-- ====================================== -->
<a name="watch"><h2>The Watch Window</h2></a>

Watchpoints are used to determine the approximate point in the 
code where a specific memory location or a location in a range of 
memory is written to or read from. A watchpoint defines a range in 
memory and causes the debugger to stop the program if any value in 
that memory range changes or is accessed. 
<p>

You can set watchpoints on variables in the Data/Object window, on 
memory locations in the Memory window, or on ranges. 
<p>

The Watch window, shown in Figure 24-77, displays a list of all 
watchpoints set in the program. You can view the memory locations 
of watchpoints and clear watchpoints selectively. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure24_77.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 24-77 Watch window] 
	<p>

If no watchpoints are set in the program, the Watch window displays 
the following message: 

<pre>
	No watchpoints defined 
</pre>

After watchpoints are set on data in the program, the Watch window 
displays the following information: 

<pre>
	<i>name</i> [<i>address range</i>] 
</pre>

<i>name:</i> If the watchpoint has been set on a variable in the
Data/Object window, this field contains the name of the variable. For 
Memory window watchpoints, the field contains the string memory. 
<p>

<i>address range:</i> This is the range of memory being watched. 
<p>

<i>Byte1:</i> This shows the successive bytes being watched in the 
memory range. 
<p>

The Watch window has two local menus, Show and Commands, 
listed in Table 24-21. 

<pre>
	Table 24-21 Watch window commands 

	<b>Menu		Menu Item		Shortcut</b>

	Show		Memory			Ctrl+E 
	Commands	Clear Watchpoint	Ctrl+C 
			Clear All Watchpoints	Ctrl+K 
</pre>

The local menu commands of the Watch window are described 
below. 


<h3>Show menu</h3>

The Show menu contains one command that shows the starting 
address of the memory, and displays the memory.

<dt><b>Memory</b>
<dd>Displays the starting address of the watchpoint range and updates 
the Memory window to display the memory at that address. 
</dl>

<h3>Commands menu</h3>

The commands in this menu let you clear selected watchpoints or all 
the watchpoints in the program.
