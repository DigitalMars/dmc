<h1>19. Class Editor Reference</h1>

This chapter describes menu operations and mouse functions 
available in the Class Editor. For an introduction to this tool, see 
Chapter 5, "Defining Classes and Their Hierarchies." 


<h2>The Class Editor Window</h2>

There are several ways to open a Class Editor window: 

<ul>
	<li> Choose <b>Class Editor</b> from the <b>Goto View</b> submenu of 
	the IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu. 

	<li> Double-click on the Class Editor icon in the Views 
	toolbox, or drag the icon from the toolbox to the 
	desktop. 

	<li> Choose <b>New!</b> from another Class Editor window's menu 
	bar. 

	<li> Double-click on a class in the Hierarchy Editor graphical 
	display. 

	<li> In the Class pane, move the cursor towards the left 
	margin until its orientation changes and it points to the 
	right. Then highlight one or more classes and drag them 
	onto the desktop. 

	<li> In the Members pane, move the cursor towards the left 
	margin until its orientation changes and it points to the 
	right. Then highlight one or more members and drag 
	them onto the desktop. 

	<li> Double-click on an entry in the Query Implementors 
	window. 

	<li> In the Query Implementors window, move the cursor 
	towards the left margin until its orientation changes and 
	it points to the right. Then highlight one or more entries 
	and drag them onto the desktop. 
</ul>

Multiple instances of the Class Editor may be open at the same time. 
These windows share data among themselves and with Hierarchy 
Editor windows, so changes made in one window are transmitted 
instantly to the others. 


<h3>Edit menu commands</h3>

With one exception, the commands in the <b>Edit</b> menu (Figure 19-1) 
operate on text in the Source pane and are identical in function to 
the corresponding <b>Edit</b> menu commands in Source windows. For a 
description, see Chapter 21, "Text Editor Reference." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-1 Edit menu commands 

<h4>Global Undo</h4>

Cancels the last operation performed in the Class Editor or Hierarchy 
Editor (such as Add Class or Add Member). The text of this menu 
item changes to reflect the previous operation performed in the Class 
Editor. 


<h3>Goto menu commands</h3>

The commands in the <b>Goto</b> menu (Figure 19-2) are used to move 
around within the Source pane and are identical to the 
corresponding <b>Goto</b> menu commands in Source windows. For a 
description, see Chapter 21, "Text Editor Reference." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-2 Goto menu commands 


<h3>Macro menu commands</h3>

The commands in the <b>Macro</b> menu (Figure 19-3) are identical to 
<b>Macro</b> menu commands in Source windows. For a description, see 
Chapter 21, "Text Editor Reference." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-3 Macro menu commands 

<h3>New! command</h3>

This command opens another Class Editor window. 


<h3>Classes pane pop-up menu commands</h3>

The Classes pane pop-up menu (Figure 19-4) contains commands to 
add and modify classes and inheritance relationships, and to access 
Class Editor options. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-4 Classes pane pop-up menu commands 

<h4>Add Derived</h4>
Opens a dialog box (Figure 19-5) that lets you add a new class to the 
hierarchy. The new class is a derived class of the currently selected 
class(es), whose name is shown in the dialog box's title. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_5.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-5 Create Derived Class dialog box 

<h5>Class name</h5>
Specifies a name for the new class. 


<h5>Header file</h5>
Contains the name of the header file into which the class declaration 
is placed. By default, the first eight characters of the class name (with 
 .h appended) are used as the header file name. You may type an 
alternative filename into the textbox, or click on Browse to select a 
filename from the <b>Class Header File</b> dialog box. 


<h4>Add Top</h4>
Adds a top-level (baseless) class. The dialog box that opens as a 
result of selecting this command is identical in function to the one 
that opens when you choose the <b>Add Derived</b> command. 


<h4>Add Sibling</h4>
Adds a class that is a sibling of (derived from the same base class as) 
the currently selected class. The dialog box that opens as a result of 
selecting this command is identical in function to the one that opens 
when you choose the <b>Add Derived</b> command. You cannot add 
siblings to classes with multiple base classes. 


<h4>Show Header</h4>
Opens a new Source window to edit the header file containing the 
declaration of the currently selected class. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
You can also perform this action by moving the 
cursor towards the left margin of the Class pane 
until its orientation changes and it points to the 
right. Then select a class and drag it onto the 
desktop while holding down the Control key. 


<h4>Connect Base</h4>
Opens the <b>Add Base</b> dialog box (Figure 19-6) that lets you add a 
base class to the selected class. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-6 Add Base dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>
These options indicate the base class access specifier: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Public:</b> <dd>Public members of the base class are public members of the 
derived class, and protected members of the base class are protected 
members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are 
protected members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are private 
members of the derived class. 
</dl>


<h5>Virtual</h5>
Specifies the base class to be virtual. 


<h5>Base class</h5>
Specifies the class that is made a base of the selected class. You can 
select more than one class to make a base class by holding down the 
Control key while clicking on the class name, or by holding down 
the Shift key while selecting a range of classes. 


<h4>Edit Base Attributes</h4>
Opens the <b>Edit Base Attributes</b> dialog box (Figure 19-7) with which 
you change the attributes of the connection between the selected 
class and its base class. 
<p>

This command is disabled if classes are sorted alphabetically rather 
than hierarchically. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-7 Edit Base Attributes dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>
These options indicate the base class access specifier: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Public:</b> <dd>Public members of the base class are public members of the 
derived class, and protected members of the base class are protected 
members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are 
protected members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are private 
members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Don't change:</b> <dd>Appears only if you are editing the attributes of more 
than one connection and the base class access specifiers are not all 
identical. It means that the base class access specifiers are not 
altered. It lets you change the Virtual specifier of all connections 
without affecting their individual access specifiers. 
</dl>

<h5>Virtual</h5>
If selected, this option specifies the base class to be virtual. If grayed, 
the virtual setting is left unchanged. 
<p>


If the selected class is derived from multiple bases, only the 
attributes of the connection with the base class immediately above in 
the Classes pane are changed. 


<h4>Delete Base Connection</h4>
Deletes the connection between the selected class and its base class. 
If the class is derived from multiple bases, only the connection with 
the base class immediately above it in the Classes pane is removed. 
<p>


You will be prompted to confirm this if the Confirm Inheritance 
Changes option on the General page of the <b>Editing/Browsing 
Settings</b> dialog box is selected. 
<p>


This command is disabled if classes are sorted alphabetically rather 
than hierarchically. 


<h4>Settings</h4>
Opens the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box, in which you set 
general Class Editor and text editor options. Details of this dialog 
box are discussed in "Class Editor Settings," later in this chapter. 


<h3>Members pane pop-up menu commands</h3>

The Members pane pop-up menu (Figure 19-8) contains commands 
to add, delete, and modify class members, and to access Class Editor 
options. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_8.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-8 Members pane pop-up menu commands 


<h4>Add</h4>
Opens the <b>Add Member</b> dialog box (Figure 19-9). The new member 
is added to the class whose members are currently displayed in the 
Members pane. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_9.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-9 Add Member dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>
These options specify the member access control: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Public:</b> <dd>Public members are accessible from outside the member's 
class. 

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Protected members are accessible only within the 
member's class, derived classes, and their friends. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Private members are accessible only within the member's 
class and its friends. 
</dl>

<h5>Storage</h5>
These options specify the member storage class: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Normal:</b> <dd>The member has no storage modifiers. 

<dt><b>Static:</b> <dd>Only one copy of the member exists; it is shared by all 
objects of the member's class. 

<dt><b>Virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function may be overridden in derived 
classes. 

<dt><b>Pure virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function must be overridden in 
derived classes; the class is abstract. 

<dt><b>Friend (functions only):</b> <dd>The named function is allowed access to 
the class's private and protected members. 
</dl>

<h5>Inline</h5>
Requests inline implementation of a function. Causes its definition to 
be placed in the <tt>.h</tt> file. 


<h5>Declaration</h5>
Contains the member declaration. For data items, enter the type and 
member name (for example, <tt>int nCats</tt>). For functions, enter the 
return type, function name, and argument types (for example, <tt>void 
AddCats(int)</tt>). Do not precede the declaration with storage 
specifiers; use the option buttons above. Trailing semicolons are 
optional. 


<h5>Source file</h5>
Contains the name of the source file into which the member 
definition is placed. By default, the first eight characters of the class 
name (with <tt>.cpp</tt> appended) are used as the source file name. You 
may type an alternative filename into the textbox, or click on Browse 
to select an alternative filename from the <b>Member Source File</b> 
dialog box. 
<p>


The member declaration is placed in the class declaration. If the 
specified source file does not already exist, it is created and added to 
the project. By default, empty definitions of inline functions are 
placed in the header file. Empty definitions of normal, static, and 
virtual functions, as well as static data members, are placed in the 
source file. 


<h4>Delete</h4>
Deletes the currently selected member. If the Confirm Member 
Delete option on the General page of the <b>Editing/Browsing 
Settings</b> dialog box is selected, you are asked to confirm the 
deletion. The member's declaration and definition (if applicable) are 
removed from the header and source files. 


<h4>Edit Attributes</h4>
Opens the <b>Change Member Attributes</b> dialog box (Figure 19-10), 
which you use to edit access and storage specifiers of the selected 
member. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_10.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-10 Change Member Attributes dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>
These options specify the member access control: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Public:</b> <dd>Public members are accessible from outside the member's 
class. 

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Protected members are accessible only within the 
member's class, derived classes, and their friends. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Private members are accessible only within the member's 
class and its friends. 

<dt><b>Don't change:</b> <dd>Only appears if you are editing the attributes of more 
than one member and their access controls are not all identical. It 
means that the access control is not altered. It lets you change other 
member attributes without also affecting their individual access 
controls. 
</dl>

<h5>Storage</h5>
These options specify the member storage class: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Normal:</b> <dd>The member has no storage modifiers. 

<dt><b>Static:</b> <dd>Only one copy of the member exists; it is shared by all 
objects of the member's class. 

<dt><b>Virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function may be overridden in derived 
classes. 

<dt><b>Pure virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function must be overridden; the 
class is abstract. 

<dt><b>Friend (functions only):</b> <dd>The named function is allowed access to 
the class's protected and private members. 

<dt><b>Don't change:</b> <dd>Only appears if you are editing the attributes of more 
than one member and their storage classes are not all identical. It 
means that the storage class is not altered. It lets you change other 
member attributes without affecting their individual storage classes. 
</dl>

<h5>Inline</h5>
Requests inline implementation of a function. If grayed, the current 
setting is left unchanged. 


<h5>Source file</h5>
If applicable, this option contains the name of the source file holding 
the member definition. You may change the filename in the textbox, 
or click on Browse to select an alternative filename from the 
<b>Member Source File</b> dialog box. 


<h4>Show Source</h4>
Opens a new Source window to show the source file containing the 
definition of the currently selected member. 
<p>


If you add new functions or static data definitions to the source file 
or alter function argument or return types, you must update the class 
header to reflect the changes. 


<h4>Settings</h4>
Opens the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box that lets you set 
general Class Editor and text editor options. Details of this dialog 
box are discussed in "Class Editor Settings," later in this chapter. 


<h3>Source pane pop-up menu commands</h3>

With one exception, commands in the Source pane pop-up menu 
(Figure 19-11) are identical to the corresponding commands in 
Source windows. For a description, see Chapter 21, "Text Editor 
Reference." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_11.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-11 Source pane pop-up menu commands 

<h4>Save</h4>
Saves the program code shown in the Source pane and places it in 
the appropriate source or header file. 
<p>


Changes to static data and to function argument and return types 
made in the source code are updated automatically in the class 
declaration and Members pane. 


<h3>Class editor mouse functions</h3>

The mouse is used to select classes and members, perform editing 
operations, open pop-up menus, and change the relative sizes of 
Class Editor panes. As mentioned in "The Class Editor Window" 
above, drag and drop operations are supported. 
<p>


To resize the panes, first position the cursor over the dividing line 
between panes. The cursor changes to a two-headed arrow. Then, 
press the left mouse button and drag the separator to the desired 
location. 


<h4>Classes pane</h4>
The right mouse button opens the pop-up menu (see "Classes pane 
pop-up menu commands," earlier in this chapter). 
<p>


Select a class by clicking on it. Several classes may be selected by 
clicking on each one while holding down Control. The members of 
the class last selected appear in the Members pane. You may drag 
and drop a class into the source pane; the class name is inserted into 
the buffer. 


<h4>Members pane</h4>
The right mouse button opens the pop-up menu (see "Members 
pane pop-up menu commands," earlier in this chapter). 
<p>


Select a member by clicking on it. Several members may be selected 
by clicking on each one while holding down Control. 
<p>


Double-clicking on a member causes its definition (if appropriate) or 
declaration to appear in the Source pane. If the source is not 
available, the declaration is displayed. 
<p>


You may drag and drop a member into the source pane; the member 
declaration is inserted into the buffer. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
In addition to clicking on it, you can select a 
member when the Members pane is active by 
typing its name. As you type, the Class Editor 
attempts to automatically complete the name. 
(Depending on the rate at which you type, it may 
consider a character to be the first character of a 
new selection, rather than the next character in the 
current select operation.) 


<h4>Source pane</h4>
The right mouse button opens the pop-up menu (see "Source pane 
pop-up menu commands," earlier in this chapter). 
<p>


The source pane supports typical Source window mouse and cursor 
operations, as described in Chapter 21, "Text Editor Reference." 


<h3>Toolbar commands</h3>

The Class Editor toolbar (Figure 19-12) offers quick access to several 
menu options. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_12.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-12 Class Editor toolbar

<dt><b>Connect base:</b> <dd>Same as choosing <b>Connect Base</b> from the Classes 
pane pop-up menu. 

<dt><b>Play macro:</b> <dd>Same as choosing <b>Play</b> from the <b>Macro</b> menu. 
</dl>

<h2>Class Editor Settings</h2>

You can access Class Editor settings by choosing <b>Text Settings</b> from 
the <b>Edit</b> menu, or <b>Settings</b> from the Classes or Members pane pop-up 
menus. These commands open the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> 
dialog box, a workspace with tabs along the top margin. The tabs 
are used to switch between several sets of options. The Class, 
Member, and General options are discussed in this section; the 
remaining options pertain to text editing and are discussed in 
Chapter 21, "Text Editor Reference." 


<h3>General options</h3>

The General options set (Figure 19-13) contains options for undo 
levels, class/member bar confirmations, output window actions, and 
key bindings, as well as some options related to the text editor. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_13.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 19-13 General options 

<h4>Browser operations</h4>
Specifies the number of operations that can be undone in the Class 
and Hierarchy Editors with the Global Undo command. 


<h4>Text edits, per buffer</h4>
Specifies the number of edit operations that can be undone, per 
buffer. 


<h4>Confirmations</h4>
These options enable confirmation requests for various operations in 
the Class and Hierarchy Editors. You can enable confirmations of: 

<ul>
	<li> Member deletions 
	<li> Inheritance changes 
</ul>

<h4>Open output window on message</h4>
Lets the IDDE open an error window whenever there is an error of 
any kind (during compilation, during parsing, and so on.) 


<h4>Keyboard emulation file</h4>
Specifies the key bindings set to be used by the text editor. 


<h4>Multiple selections</h4>

This option enables multiple selections in lists in the Class and 
Hierarchy editors: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Yes:</b> <dd>Multiple selections are allowed. 

<dt><b>No:</b> <dd>Multiple selections are not allowed. 

<dt><b>Confirm:</b> <dd>Multiple selections are allowed, but a confirmation request 
is displayed each time an operation is performed on multiple classes 
or members. 
</dl>

<h3>Class options</h3>

The Class options set (Figure 19-14) lets you specify the display 
order and font of classes in the Classes pane. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure19_14.gif">
