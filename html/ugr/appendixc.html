<h1>C. Using NetBuild</h1>

NetBuild is a feature of Digital Mars C++ that lets you distribute the task
of building a project across the network. Using NetBuild, you can employ
any idle PCs on the network to compile your files.
<p>

Before you can use
NetBuild you must install the NetBuild 
Administrator software on your network server and the NetBuild 
Server software on any PCs that will participate in the distributed 
build. For information on how to install the NetBuild feature of 
Digital Mars C++, see the <i>Getting Started Guide</i>. 
<p>

The following sections detail how to use the Digital Mars C++ NetBuild 
feature. 


<h2>Using the Build Client</h2>

Your PC (the one controlling the build) is called the build client. 
Functioning as a client, it must request a server to perform a task. 
The PCs that compile your project are called build servers. 


<h3>Configuring the build client</h3>

The options for controlling the NetBuild on the build client are 
located in the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog box. To access these options, 
select <b>Settings</b> from the IDDE's <b>Project</b> menu, then click on the 
Build tab to bring up the Build page of the <b>Project Options</b> dialog 
box. In the list of subpages on the left, choose Make. 
<p>


The Make subpage is shown in Figure C-1. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figurec_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure C-1 The Make subpage 
	<p>

To turn on the NetBuild feature, make sure that the Use NetBuild 
check box has a check mark. 
<p>


If you enable the Use Remote Headers option, the client PC instructs 
the build servers to use the header files on their local drives (as 
opposed to getting the header files from the build client). This 
option can be overridden on the build server side by disabling the 
Use Local Headers option in the Build Server Configuration window. 
See "Configuring a build server," later in this chapter. 
<p>


When you enable the Use NetBuild option, you must specify the 
pathname of the build server control directory in the Working 
Directory textbox. This is the directory in which the NetBuild 
Administrator is installed on the network server. You specify this 
pathname in the Working Directory textbox. All the PCs participating 
in the distributed build must have access to this directory. 
<p>


If your network administrator has set up a network password, you 
must enter it in the Remote Password textbox. If sources are shared 
through Microsoft Network on a local hard disk, and a sharing 
password is used for access protection, it must be specified in the 
Remote Password textbox. 


<h3>Starting a distributed build</h3>

Once you have configured the build client, every time you rebuild or 
update your project, the NetBuild system identifies the build 
server( s) that can participate in the distributed build. If there is at 
least one build server available, the distributed build can occur; 
otherwise the build client builds the project locally. For information 
on starting and configuring build servers, see the following section. 
<p>


When the distributed build process begins, the Build Client window 
opens on the client PC's screen (see Figure C-2). This window allows 
you to monitor the progress of the distributed build. 
<p>


When the build is done, a message specifying successful completion 
or an error condition is displayed in the output window on the build 
client. 


<h3>Monitoring a distributed build</h3>

You can monitor a distributed build from the build client PC by 
viewing the messages displayed in the Build Client window. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figurec_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure C-2 The Build Client window 


This window displays an icon each for the build client and each of 
the build servers participating in the distributed build. Each icon 
shows a list of the programs and header files being handled by that 
particular PC. The name of the build server is shown at the top of its 
icon. 


<h3>Stopping a distributed build</h3>

You can cancel a build from the build client PC by: 

<ul>
	<li> Choosing the Stop! command in the output window 

	<li> Choosing <b>Stop Build</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu 

	<li> From the client PC, clicking the Cancel button in the 
	build client window 
</ul>


Depending on the options that have been specified for the project 
being compiled, there may be a short delay before the distributed 
build stops. 


<h2>Using a Build Server</h2>

A build server is a PC that is helping the build client PC compile a 
project. A build server normally is idle until a client requests it to 
perform a task. There must be at least one build server in the 
distributed build environment. 


<h3>Starting a build server</h3>

You start the NetBuild Server application by double-clicking on its 
icon, or as you start any other Windows program. Once started, the 
server application is minimized into an icon. It then runs in the 
background, waiting to receive a task from a build client. 


<h3>Configuring a build server</h3>

When the build server compiles files, the build server application 
name changes to the name of the file it is compiling. 
<p>

Double-click on the NetBuild Server application icon to display a 
Build Server Configuration window (see Figure C-3). 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figurec_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure C-3 The Build Server Configuration window 
	<p>

This window displays the build server name, the pathname of the 
working directory, and the pathname of the directory containing the 
header files used in the compilation. (If the pathname of the working 
directory is changed, then the pathname must be identical in the 
client working directory.) This window also contains a message area; 
this is where messages, such as the name of the file being compiled, 
the file being read, and error messages, are displayed. 
<p>


If Use Local Header Files option is enabled, the build server looks 
for the header files in the "Directory for Header Files" specified in 
the build server window. If the Use Local Header Files option is not 
enabled, the build server gets the header files from the build client 
PC. This option is enabled if the Use Remote Headers option is 
enabled on the client PC; however, you can still force the build client 
to retrieve the headers from the build client by disabling the Use 
Local Header Files option in the Build Server Configuration window. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
If Use Local Header Files is selected and the build 
server needs a header file and cannot find it, the 
build server sends the job back to the build client 
for processing. 
<p>


If the Status Bar option is selected, the status bar is displayed at the 
bottom of the Build Server Configuration window. 


<h3>Stopping a build server</h3>

You can close the NetBuild Server application by: 

<ul>
	<li> Pressing Alt+F4 

	<li> Double-clicking on the system menu button 

	<li> Choosing Close on the system menu 
</ul>

If the server is participating in a distributed build when you try to 
stop it, the dialog box shown in Figure C-4 is displayed. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figurec_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure C-4 Abort Compile dialog box 
	<p>

If you click on Cancel in the dialog box, the build server resumes 
processing. If you click on Close, the build server finishes processing 
any files that are in the queue (that is, files currently being compiled 
and files already read), then stops. If you click on Abort, the build 
server halts the current compilation and returns the uncompleted job 
to the build client. If you selected Close or Abort, the NetBuild 
Server application closes and you must restart it if you want the PC 
to be able to participate in a distributed build again. (See "Starting a 
build server," earlier in this chapter.) 


<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

If the build client or build server seems to hang (because no 
messages are being displayed), wait for a few minutes. NetBuild tries 
to establish a connection several times before giving up. 
<p>

If both the build client and build server start, but the build server 
does not compile your program, then: 


<ol>
	<li> Make sure you selected the NetBuild option on the Make 
	Subpage. 

	<li> Make sure the NetBuild Working Directory has the 
	correct pathname for the build server control directory. 

	<li> Make sure the build client and build server have the 
	same drive mapping. 

	<li> Make sure the build servers have access tot he include 
	directories. The include files can be installed on the build 
	server, or in a fully-sharable directory on the build client. 
</ol>


If the build client does not receive messages from the build server( s): 

<ol>
	<li> Make sure the network is not down. 

	<li> Make sure the build server is still running. If the build 
	server is still displaying messages, the network 
	connection may be broken. If not, Windows may be 
	hung. If the build server is in iconized form, it may have 
	finished the compile, but was not able to communicate 
	with the build client. 
</ol>


If files do not compile or the build server can't find header files: 

<ol>
	<li> Make sure all relevant files have been moved to the 
	network drive. 

	<li> Make sure the environment variables that indicate where 
	to find the header files are set properly. 
</ol>
