<h1>16. More about Project Build Settings</h1>

This chapter details the options for controlling how a project is 
built continuing from
<a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15, More about Projects and Workspaces</a>.
It lists and explains the options on the Build 
page of the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog box. Access these options 
by selecting <b>Settings</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu, then clicking on the 
Build tab. 
<p>

The Build page of the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog box is composed of 
18 subpages. The subpages are displayed in a listbox on the left of 
the window. To access a particular subpage, click on its name. The 
options displayed on the right change with each subpage. Subpages 
are organized hierarchically, as shown in the listbox. 
<p>


This chapter covers all the subpages on the Build page of the 
<b>Project Options</b> dialog box. The first section introduces the 
build settings and the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog box, and the later 
sections describe the subpages in the order in which they are listed 
on the Build page. 
<p>


For more detailed information on how each of these options affects 
the compilation of code, refer to the
<a href="../ctg/ctg.html" title="Compiler & Tools Guide" target="_top">
<i>Compiler and Tools Guide</i><a>. 
<a href="appendixb.html">Appendix B, IDDE Settings and Command-Line Options</a>,
details 
how each of these options map to the corresponding DMC, Optlink, 
Make, or Librarian command line options. 


<h2>Introducing Build Settings</h2>

Choose the <b>Settings</b> command from the IDDE's <b>Project</b> menu to 
open the <b>Project Settings</b> multipage dialog box. Using the tabs at 
the top of the dialog box, select different pages, each of 
which presents a set of options. 
<p>


Click on the <b>Build</b> tab in the dialog box to open the Build page. The 
Build page is composed of subpages of options. Select a subpage by 
clicking on its name in the listbox on the left of the Build page. The 
following subpages are available:

<a name="compiler"><h2>Compiler</h2></a>

The Compiler subpage (Figure 16-1) contains a variety of parameters 
controlling compilation. 

	<p>
	<img align="center" alt="Figure 16-1 Compiler subpage" src="figure16_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-1 Compiler subpage]

<h4>Enforce ANSI compatibility</h4>

Establishes the necessary parameters so the compiler accepts only C/C++ 
code that conforms to ANSI standards. Refer to the <i>Compiler and 
Tools Guide</i> for information on the restrictions that take effect.


<h4>Treat source as C++</h4>

With this option selected, the compiler treats C source files as C++ 
files. The option is useful for:

<ul>
	<li> Compiling the file to take advantage of type-safe linkage 
	<li> Linking a C file to a C++ file without changing it or giving it 
	a C++-compatible extension 
</ul>

This option also works on C++ header files with the .h 
extension. 


<h4>Relax type checking</h4>

Causes the compiler to use relaxed (non-ANSI) type checking. The 
following data types are then treated as equivalent: 

<ul>
	<li> <tt>char == signed char == unsigned char</tt>
	<li> <tt>short == unsigned short</tt> 
	<li> <tt>long == unsigned long</tt> 
</ul>


In addition, for 16-bit compilations: 

<ul>
	<li> <tt>int == unsigned == enum == short</tt> 
</ul>

And for 32-bit compilations: 

<ul>
	<li> <tt>int == unsigned == enum == long</tt> 
</ul>

The option is useful for quickly porting code from compilers that do 
not obey the full set of ANSI type-checking rules. 


<h4>Suppress predefined macros</h4>

Suppresses the definition of the non-ANSI predefined macros. 


<h4>Exception handling</h4>

Enables implementation of exception handling. 


<h4>Run-time type information</h4>

Enables implementation of run-time type information. 


<h4>Enable new[], delete[] overloading</h4>

Enables overloading of <tt>operator new[]</tt> and <tt>operator delete[]</tt>. It 
also sets the predefined macro _ENABLE_ARRAYNEW to 1. 
<p>

Compiling with Enforce ANSI compatibility automatically enables 
this option. 


<h3>char behavior</h3>

This option controls the way the compiler treats a <tt>char</tt> type. By 
default, the compiler treats <tt>char</tt> types as <tt>signed</tt>. Set this option to 
unsigned to quickly port code that depends on <tt>unsigned char</tt> 
types. Note that the behavior of the run-time library routines is not 
affected by this option unless they are also recompiled. 

<dl>
	<dt><b>signed:</b> <dd>Makes <tt>char</tt> types behave as <tt>signed char</tt> types. 

	<dt><b>unsigned:</b> <dd>Makes <tt>char</tt> types behave as <tt>unsigned char</tt> types. 

	<dt><b>char == unsigned char:</b> <dd>Changes the type of <tt>char</tt> to be unsigned. 
</dl>


<h3>Prototyping</h3>

This option specifies how the compiler handles function prototypes. 
New code should always be fully prototyped, due to the 
requirements of type-safe linkage and the support for alternative 
linkage conventions. 
<p>

There are three prototyping possibilities: Standard, Autoprototype, 
and Strict. 


<dl>
	<dt><b>Standard:</b> <dd>Turns off autoprototyping and strict prototyping. 

	<dt><b>Autoprototype:</b> <dd>Enables the compiler to generate a prototype 
	according to the way the function is used, even if one is not 
	specified for a function. Subsequent uses are checked against the 
	generated prototype. This is especially useful when compiling old C 
	code that is not completely prototyped. 

	<dt><b>Strict:</b> <dd>Requires that all functions be declared (prototyped) before 
	being used. This declaration provides the compiler with the function 
	name, return type, and storage class of a function, as well as the 
	number and type of arguments that may be passed to it. Once the 
	compiler encounters a function prototype, it can check each function 
	call in the source file against that prototype and flag an error for the 
	calls that do not match it. 
</dl>


<h3>International characters</h3>

This option specifies how the compiler interprets 2-byte Asian 
language character codes within character constants and strings. That 
is, if a character code represents the first byte of a 2-byte sequence, 
the second byte is not checked to see whether it is a backslash or a 
closed quote. The second byte cannot be a NULL (0), a carriage 
return (0x0D), or an end-of-file (0x1A). 


<dl>
	<dt><b>None:</b> <dd>Allows no 2-byte sequences. 

	<dt><b>Japanese:</b> <dd>Signals the 2-byte sequence with a value in the range 
	0x81 ... 0x9F and 0xE0 ... 0xFC 

	<dt><b>Taiwanese/Chinese:</b> <dd>Signals the 2-byte sequence with a value in 
	the range 0x81 ... 0xFC 

	<dt><b>Korean:</b> <dd>Signals the 2-byte sequence with a value in the 
	range 0x81 ... 0xFD 
</dl>


<h3>Other options</h3>

The options below direct the compiler to define a macro, include a 
header file, or instantiate a template. 


<h4>Defines</h4>
Specify macro definitions on the compiler command 
line. Separate multiple Defines with a semicolon (;). 


<h4>Include filename</h4>
Directs the compiler to include a header file for all modules in the 
project. 


<h4>Instantiate template</h4>
Creates an instance of a template in the program. 


<hr><!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="code"><h2>Code Generation</h2></a>

The Code Generation subpage, shown in Figure 16-2, contains 
parameters that control how the compiler generates code. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure16_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-2 Code Generation subpage 


<h4>Pointer validation</h4>
Makes the resulting program validate each pointer as it is 
dereferenced; if the pointer is invalid, a run-time error occurs. This 
slows and slightly increases the size of the resulting code. 


<h4>Generate stack frame</h4>
Generates a stack frame for each function. The stack frame is 
generally for the use of the debugger. 


<h4>Check stack overflow</h4>
Inserts stack overflow checking at the beginning of each function. 
The resulting program aborts with an error message if it detects a 
stack overflow. 


<h4>Fast floating point</h4>
Directs the compiler to produce the fastest possible floating-point 
code. No compatibility checking is performed. 


<h4>Generate inline 8087 code</h4>
Causes the compiler to generate inline 80x87 instructions. It 
significantly speeds up floating-point code, reduces its size, and 
improves its accuracy. 


<h4>Generate virtual function tables in far data</h4>
Affects Compact and Large memory models only. It causes the virtual 
function tables to be placed in far data segments rather than in the 
code segment. 


<h4>Use Pascal calling convention</h4>
Makes Pascal, instead of cdecl, the default linkage for all functions 
and global data. Because all C library routines have cdecl linkage, 
they must be prototyped as such before being called. Therefore, 
include the appropriate header files. The <tt>main()</tt> function 
must also be declared cdecl for the linker to find it. 
<p>

Using Pascal as the default linkage type results in a roughly 3% code 
size reduction and a corresponding speed up in generated code. 


<h4>Use Stdcall calling convention</h4>
Makes stdcall the default linkage for all functions and global data, 
instead of cdecl. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
Under Windows 95 and Windows NT, Digital Mars's 
name mangling scheme now appends the string 
"@nn" to the names of all stdcall functions (where 
nn is the number of bytes in parameters to the 
function). Previous versions of Digital Mars C++ did 
not append this string to mangled names. 


<h4>Enable function-level link</h4>
Directs the compiler to encapsulate functions in initialized common 
blocks (COMDAT records). This allows the linker to perform 
function-level linking, which results in a smaller executable. 


<h4>No default library</h4>
Prevents the compiler from embedding the default library record in 
the object file. This option can result in a significant decrease in 
program size when generating a large library. 


<h4>Set data threshold</h4>
Places large arrays in far data segments. The threshold size is set in 
the adjacent textbox. 


<h3>Code segment</h3>

These options govern the ways in which code segments are handled. 


<h4>Generate new segment for each function</h4>
Causes the compiler to start a new code segment each time it 
encounters a global far function. The name of the segment is the 
name of the function with <tt>_TEXT</tt> appended. 


<h4>Override default code segment name</h4>
Overrides the default code segment name. Type the new name in 
the Name textbox. 


<h4>Put switch tables in code segment</h4>
Places switch tables in the code segment rather than in the data 
segment. It is useful when data segment space is critical. Do not use 
this option when the code segment in a Small or Compact model 
program is close to overflowing. 


<h4>Put expression strings in code segment</h4>
Puts expression string literals into the code segment rather than 
wasting space in a group. 


<h3>Struct alignment</h3>

Sets the boundaries for structure alignment. The 
default is to align members within a structure on word boundaries 
for 16-bit programs. This maximizes speed on computers with a 16-bit 
bus (such as a PC-AT). The default in 32-bit DOS programs is to 
align on double-word boundaries to maximize performance. 


<dl>
	<dt><b>Byte:</b> <dd>Aligns structures on byte boundaries. 

	<dt><b>Word:</b> <dd>Aligns structures on word boundaries. 

	<dt><b>Double Word:</b> <dd>Aligns structures on double-word boundaries. This is 
	the default for 32-bit DOS applications. 

	<dt><b>Quad Word:</b> <dd>Aligns structures on boundaries that are multiples of 
	four words. This is the default for Win32 applications. 
</dl>


<h3>Target CPU</h3>

Generates code tailored for the instruction 
set of a specific CPU. 

<dl>
	<dt><b>88:</b> <dd>Generates 16-bit code using the 8088 instruction set. 

	<dt><b>286:</b> <dd>Generates 16-bit code using the 80286 instruction set. Programs 
	compiled with this option will not run on an 8088 or 8086 processor. 

	<dt><b>386:</b> <dd>Generates code optimized for machines with an 80386 CPU. 
	Programs compiled with this option require an 80386, 80486, or 
	Pentium processor. 

	<dt><b>486:</b> <dd>Generates code optimized for machines with an 80486 CPU. 
	Programs compiled with this option require a 32-bit DOS extender or 
	32-bit operating system, and an 80386, 80486, or Pentium CPU. 

	<dt><b>Pentium:</b> <dd>Generates code for the Pentium instruction set. 
</dl>

<a name="header"><h2>Header Files</h2></a>

The Header Files subpage (Figure 16-3) specifies compiler header 
file options. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure16_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-3 Header Files subpage 

<h3>Precompile options</h3>

If using a large header file or numerous small headers, 
the compiler spends considerable time compiling the same source 
code over and over again. To reduce compile time, use precompiled header files;
the compiler can load a precompiled header 
faster than it can a text header file. It is especially useful to 
precompile large header files that seldom change, such as 
<tt>windows.h</tt>. 


<h4>No headers</h4>
Disables generation and use of precompiled headers. 


<h4>All headers</h4>
In most cases, using precompiled headers is convenient and fast. 
The All Headers option automatically precompiles all header files 
defined in the project source files into the file scph. sym. The file 
scph. sym is always in the current directory or in the directory 
specified as the compiler output directory. 
<p>


Setting the All Headers option causes the compiler to generate the 
file <tt>scph.sym</tt> when it does not exist. If the <tt>scph.sym</tt> file does 
exist, the compiler assumes it is a precompiled header. The compiler 
will then test the header file to see whether all the headers it 
contains are older than the header file itself. If any are newer, or if 
the compiler flags have changed, a new <tt>scph.sym</tt> file is created; 
otherwise, the old file is loaded as a precompiled header. Setting the 
All Headers option also causes all files being compiled to use 
<tt>scph.sym</tt> as their precompiled header. 
<p>


The compiler writes out the precompiled header when the first line 
in the top-level source file is encountered, and when that line is not 
a comment or an <tt>#include</tt> statement. 


To avoid problems with precompiled headers: 

<ul>
	<li> Do not write any declarations that cross boundaries of 
	header files. Each header file should be self-contained. 

	<li> Do not write any <tt>extern "C"</tt> constructs that start in 
	one file and end in another. 

	<li> Do not depend on header files being included more than 
	once. 

	<li> Do not write any code or data definitions in header files, 
	only declarations. 
</ul>


To maximize compile speed, set the directory to a RAM disk. 
<p>

There are two circumstances in which using precompiled headers is 
not recommended: 

<ul>
	<li> The file being compiled causes <tt>scph.sym</tt> to be 
	regenerated, but that file contains a subset of the header 
	files that other files also contain. 

	<li> Included files are wrapped in <tt>#if</tt> blocks or <tt>extern 
	"C"</tt> blocks. (The <tt>extern "C"</tt> statement is a non-include 
	statement, so the precompiled header is written 
	out prior to the <tt>extern "C"</tt> block.) Embed the <tt>extern 
	"C"</tt> blocks in the included files themselves. 
</ul>


<h4>Specific header</h4>
Selects a header file to precompile individually. Type the 
header file name into the textbox. 


<h4>Use precompiled headers from directory</h4>
Tells the compiler to use precompiled headers from a specific 
directory. In the textbox, type the name of the directory in which the 
precompiled headers reside. If this directory is empty, no additional 
directories, other than the current or path directories, are searched. 


<h4>Include headers once</h4>
Tells the compiler to include each header file only once, even if it is 
named in more than one source file. Otherwise, header files are 
included whenever they are named in a source file. This option can 
be used with or without precompiled headers.

Controls the memory model the compiler uses by specifying its size: 

<dl>
	<dt><b>Tiny:</b> <dd>Tells the compiler to create a <tt>.com</tt> file active only for DOS 
	compilations. 

	<dt><b>Small:</b> <dd>Generates code with near pointers for the code segment and 
	the data segment. 

	<dt><b>Medium:</b> <dd>Generates code with far pointers for the code segment and 
	near pointers for the data segment. 

	<dt><b>Compact:</b> <dd>Generates code with near pointers for the code segment

	<dt><b>Large:</b> <dd>Generates code with far pointers for both the code and data 
	segments. 

	<dt><b>Flat:</b> <dd>Generates code for a Win32 compilation; that is active only for 
	Win32s and DOSX compilations.

<h3>Data segment</h3>

These options control the way the compiler treats the data segment 
register.
 
<h4>Assume SS==DS</h4>
Causes the compiler to generate code that assumes SS equals DS. 

<h4>Always reload DS</h4>
Causes the compiler to generate code that reloads DS at the 
beginning of each function call.

<a name="prologepilog"><h2>Windows Prolog/Epilog</h2></a>

The Windows Prolog/Epilog subpage (Figure 16-6) specifies the type 
of Windows prolog and epilog code that the compiler attaches to 
each far function in a compilation. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure16_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-6 Windows Prolog/Epilog subpage 
	<p>

The first group of radio buttons selects from predefined sets of 
prolog/epilog options. 


<h4>Set EXE defaults</h4>
Sets options to generate prologs and epilogs for a protected-mode 
Windows application, with callback functions all marked as 
<tt>_export</tt>. 


<h4>Set DLL defaults</h4>
Sets options to generate prologs and epilogs for a protected-mode 
Windows DLL, with callback and exported functions all marked as 
<tt>_export</tt>. 


<h4>Real mode full prolog/epilog</h4>
Sets options to generate prologs and epilogs for a real or protected-mode 
Windows application or DLL. 


<h4>Real mode reduced</h4>
Sets options to generate prologs and epilogs for a real or protected-mode 
Windows application or DLL with exported and callback 
functions (marked with <tt>_export</tt>). 


<h4>Real mode smart callbacks</h4>
Sets options to generate prologs and epilogs for a real or protected-mode 
Windows application with smart callbacks. In smart callbacks, 
the compiler compiles far functions with a smart prolog and epilog 
that loads the data segment from the stack segment. Use smart 
callbacks only with applications in which the data segment is the 
same as the stack segment (DS== SS). Do not use it with DLL files. 


<h4>Custom</h4>
Specifies a nonstandard set of prolog/epilog options. 
<p>


The remaining options on the Windows prolog/epilog subpage are 
discussed in the Compiler and Tools Guide. 


<hr><!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="output"><h2>Output</h2></a>

The Output subpage (Figure 16-7) controls the output generated by 
the compiler. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure16_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-7 Output subpage 

<h4>Source listing files</h4>
With this option on, the compiler creates a source listing file; its 
name is that of the source file with the extension <tt>.lst</tt>. The 
compiler inserts error messages and line numbers in the listing file. 


<h4>Verbose</h4>
Displays source and header file names, classes, function prototypes, 
and time of execution during compilation. 


<h4>Macro expansions</h4>
Tells the compiler to create macro expansions in error listings. 


<h4>Assembly listing (<tt>.cod</tt>)</h4>
Causes the compiler to generate a <tt>.cod</tt> file containing an assembly 
language representation of the program. 


<hr><!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="warnings"><h2>Warnings</h2></a>

The options on this subpage, shown in Figure 16-8, control how the 
compiler produces warnings and enables the compiler to 
generate only specific warnings. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure16_8.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-8 Warnings subpage]

<h4>Warnings</h4>

Determines the warning messages that are produced: 

<dl>
	<dt><b>All:</b> <dd>All warnings are produced. Turns on all warnings in the Selected 
	Warnings group. 

	<dt><b>Selected:</b> <dd>Only warnings that have been checked in the Selected 
	Warnings area are produced. 

	<dt><b>None:</b> <dd>No warnings are produced. Turns off all warnings in the 
	Selected Warnings group. 
</dl>


<h4>Treat warnings as errors</h4>
Causes the compiler to promote warnings to errors. Setting this 
option allows using the error window to find warnings in the 
source file. 


<h4>Turn off error maximum</h4>
Makes the compiler continue rather than stop when its error limit is 
reached. The compiler processes the entire source file and displays 
all errors it has detected. 


<h4>Selected warnings</h4>
Determines the warning messages that are produced. For more 
information on the specific warnings, refer to the <i>Compiler and Tools 
Guide</i>. 


<hr><!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="debug"><h2>Debug Information</h2></a>

The Debug Information subpage (Figure 16-9) controls the 
information the compiler places into the code for debugging. These 
options specify the level of debugging, debug information, and other 
conditions. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure16_9.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-9 Debug Information subpage 

<h4>Debug information</h4>

These radio buttons select from predefined sets of debug 
information options. 


<dl>
	<dt><b>Full:</b> <dd>Turns on all debug information. Use this set when the 
	application uses a class library or DLL. 

	<dt><b>Reduced:</b> <dd>Turns on the most frequently needed debug information. 
	Use this set for most other programs. 

	<dt><b>Custom:</b> <dd>Select the debug information to be included. 

	<dt><b>None:</b> <dd>Turns off all debug information. 
</dl>


<h4>Trace prolog/epilog</h4>
Adds the user-defined function calls <tt>__trace_pro_f</tt> and 
<tt>__trace_epi_f</tt> to the prolog and epilog, respectively, for each 
function. The prolog function is called after the stack frame is set up; 
the epilog function is called just before the stack frame is destroyed. 


<h4>Line numbers</h4>
Places line numbers corresponding to the source into the code. Line 
number information significantly increases the size of the object file. 


<h4>Symbolic debug information</h4>
Includes symbol information for all public symbols. Symbols 
significantly increase the size of the object file. 
<p>

Three additional options become available when Symbolic Debug 
Information is checked: 

<dl>
	<dt><b>Unreferenced types:</b> <dd>Generates symbols for unreferenced types 
	(for example, typedefs). 

	<dt><b>All referenced classes:</b> <dd>Forces symbols for all classes that are 
	referenced in DLL files and class libraries to be generated. 

	<dt><b>Dynamic C++ types:</b> <dd>Adds dynamic C++ class type information to 
	classes with virtual functions. To force the production of typing 
	information for a class with no virtual functions, add a dummy 
	function such as <tt>virtual void dummy(){}</tt> to the class 
	definition. 
</dl>


<h4>Make static functions global</h4>
Makes all static functions global. The linker then can enter the names 
of these functions into the map file and place global debugging 
information in the executable.

<a name="linker"><h2>Linker</h2></a>

The Linker subpage (Figure 16-10) governs the overall behavior of 
the linker. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure16_10.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 16-10 Linker subpage 

<h4>Debug information</h4>
Places debugging information in the executable file. This is the 
normal option for linking an executable for debugging using the 
IDDE. 


<h4>No default library</h4>
Causes the linker to ignore libraries specified in object files. 


<h4>Case sensitive</h4>
Causes the linker to be case sensitive. 


<h4>Far call translation</h4>
Causes the linker to convert intrasegment far calls to near calls. 


<h4>Reorder segments</h4>
Places like segments in contiguous locations. 


<h4>Export by ordinal</h4>
For 32-bit output, causes the linker to export symbols by ordinal. For 
16-bit output, when this option is on, the name text for every 
exported symbol is moved from the resident name table to the 
nonresident name table. 


<h4>Don't export names</h4>
Eliminates storage of name text for symbols exported by ordinal. 


<h4>Export, case sensitive</h4>
Makes the linker treat the import and export symbols as case 
sensitive. 


<h4>Export, uppercase</h4>
Forces the linker to convert import and export symbols to 
uppercase. 


<h4>DOSSEG ordering</h4>
Causes the linker to perform the special segment ordering used by 
Microsoft high-level languages. 


<h4>No null DOSSEG</h4>
Causes the linker not to offset the first segment by 10. 


<h4>Warn if dups</h4>
Causes the linker to warn if there are duplicate symbols in the code. 


<h4>Delete EXE/DLL on error</h4>
Deletes target executable if a link error occurs. 


<h4>Create ImpDef</h4>
Forces the linker to generate a <tt>.din</tt> file, which combines export 
information from source, definition file, and options. 


<h4>Fix DS</h4>
Turning this option on has the same effect as putting a FIXDS 
directive in the <tt>.def</tt> file. 


<h4>Keep segments in <tt>.def</tt> order</h4>
Causes the linker to keep segments in the order in which they 
appear in the <tt>.def</tt> file (Windows only). 


<h4>Requires Windows 3.0</h4>
Causes the linker to tag the executable as requiring Windows 3.0 or 
later to run. 


<h4>Requires Windows 3.1</h4>
Causes the linker to tag the executable as requiring Windows 3.1 or 
later to run. 


<h4>Generate import library</h4>
Directs the linker to build an import library (<tt>.lib</tt>) describing the 
exported symbols available to be imported from a DLL. 


<h4>Import lib page size</h4>
Sets the page size for the Generate Import Library option. 


<h4>Alignment</h4>
In conventional MS-DOS executables, causes the header to be 
rounded up to the specified size. In segmented .exe files, this 
option governs the page size. 


<h4>Base</h4>
Sets the base address of the executable. 


<h4>Entry point</h4>
Specifies the program entry point for Win32 applications.

	<p>
	[Figure 16-12 Definitions subpage 

<h4>Name</h4>
Defines the name of the application, which is used by Windows to 
identify the application. A name is required for all Windows 
applications. 


<h4>Description</h4>
Contains a description of the application. This optional string is 
placed in a Windows executable. It can be used for version control 
or to otherwise help identify the application. 


<h4>Heap size</h4>
Specifies the size of the application's local heap. The default is 4096. 
If the application frequently uses the local heap, specify a larger 
heap size. 
<p>

For Windows 3.1, heap size is a single text field. For Win32s, the 
field has two parts: Reserve and Commit, where Reserve is optional. 
Reserve tells Win32s how much heap space to try to get for this 
application. Commit specifies the amount of heap space the 
application actually needs. The two fields are separated by a comma 
(,). For example, 100000, 4096 would specify 100000 for Reserve and 
4096 for Commit. 


<h4>Stack size</h4>
Defines the size, in bytes, of the executable's stack. The default is 
4096 bytes. The stack is used for storing function arguments.
It's common to need to increase the stack size, especially for applications 
containing heavily recursive functions. 
<p>

For Windows 3.1, stack size is a single text field. For Win32s, the 
field has two parts: Reserve and Commit, where Reserve is optional. 
Reserve tells Win32s how much stack space to try to get for this 
application. Commit specifies the stack size the application actually 
needs. 


<h4>Stub</h4>
Specifies an optional file that defines the executable stub to be 
placed at the beginning of the executable. When a user tries to run 
the application from DOS, the stub is executed instead. Many 
applications use the <tt>winstub.exe</tt> file supplied with the Windows 
SDK. Any DOS or DOSX executable can be used. 


<h4>Version</h4>
Contains optional version information that becomes part of the 
executable file.

libraries and object files added explicitly to the project are linked. 
Do this by iteratively selecting files from the LIBs in Project or 
the OBJs in Project listbox, then clicking Add to move the files to the 
Link Order listbox. 
<p>

Return a file to the LIBs in Project or the OBJs in Project 
listbox by selecting the filename and clicking on Remove. 
<p>

The libraries added explicitly to the project are linked before other 
libraries. The object files added explicitly to the project are by 
default linked after the object files generated by compiling source 
files in the project. To specify object files to be linked before 
any other object files use the Prepended linker input files textbox. 
<p>

When done with the link order, click OK to return to the 
Make subpage.

<a name="externalmake"><h2>External Make</h2></a>

The options on this subpage govern the use of a make utility other 
than IDDE Make. Figure 16-19 shows the External Make subpage.

<h3>Using external make</h3>

To use a separate external Make program: 

<ol>
	<li> Select Use External Make File. 

	<li> Specify the <tt>.exe</tt> name of the Make program in the 
	Make Command Line textbox, followed by any arguments.
	The IDDE expects the program's directory to be in 
	the PATH environment variable. 

	<li> To set the Make's default directory, enter 
	the change in the Initial Directory box. By default, this is 
	the directory that contains Make. 

	<li> Use a Windows PIF file to further customize the 
	way Make behaves. 
</ol>

The next time the <b>Build</b> or <b>Rebuild All</b> command is selected,
the IDDE runs the external Make program from a DOS command-line window, 
which closes when Make is done. 
<p>

The radio buttons at the top of the dialog box control the Make 
program that will be run when the IDDE builds the project: 


<dl>
	<dt><b>Use IDDE make:</b> <dd>Use the built-in IDDE make tool. 

	<dt><b>Use external make file:</b> <dd>Use an external Make 
	program. 
</dl>


<h4>Make command line</h4>
The Make Command Line textbox holds the <tt>.exe</tt> name of the external 
Make program followed by any arguments. 


<h4>Initial directory</h4>
Use this textbox to specify the directory from which the Make utility 
will run.

<a name="librarian"><h2>Librarian</h2></a>

The Librarian subpage (Figure 16-20) specifies options for building a 
library.

<h4>Ignore case</h4>
Directs the librarian utility to ignore case in symbols. 


<h4>Do not create backup</h4>
Keeps the librarian utility from backing up the original library. When 
this option is turned off, the original library is saved in a backup file. 


<h4>Page size</h4>
Specifies the library page-swapping size.
