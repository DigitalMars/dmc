<h1>20. Hierarchy Editor Reference</h1>


This chapter describes menu operations and mouse functions 
available in the Hierarchy Editor. For an introduction to this tool, see 
Chapter 5, "Defining Classes and Their Hierarchies." 


<h2>The Hierarchy Editor Window</h2>

To open a Hierarchy Editor window you have several choices: 

<ul>
	<li> Choose <b>Hierarchy Editor</b> from the <b>Goto View</b> 
	submenu of the IDDE's <b>Window</b> menu. 

	<li> Double-click on the Hierarchy Editor icon in the Views 
	toolbox, or drag the icon from the toolbox to the 
	desktop. 

	<li> Choose <b>New!</b> from another Hierarchy Editor window's 
	menu bar. 
</ul>

Multiple instances of the Hierarchy Editor may be open at the same 
time. These windows share data among themselves and with Class 
Editor windows, so changes made in one window are transmitted 
instantly to the others. 


<h3>Edit menu commands</h3>

Commands in the <b>Edit</b> menu (Figure 20-1) let you undo Hierarchy 
Editor operations and print the graphical display. 


	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-1 Edit menu commands 


<h4>Global Undo</h4>
Cancels the last operation performed in the Hierarchy Editor (such as 
Add Class or Add Member). The text of this menu item changes to 
reflect the previous operation performed in the Hierarchy Editor. 


<h4>Print</h4>
Opens the <b>Print</b> dialog box. See Chapter 21, "Text Editor 
Reference." 


<h3>Macro menu commands</h3>

The commands in the <b>Macro</b> menu (Figure 20-2) are identical to 
<b>Macro</b> menu commands in Source windows. For a description, see 
Chapter 21, "Text Editor Reference." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-2 Macro menu commands 

<h3>New! command</h3>

Opens another Hierarchy Editor window. 


<h3>Pop-up menu commands</h3>

Contains commands to add and modify classes and inheritance 
relationships, and to access Hierarchy Editor options. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-3 Hierarchy Editor pop-up menu commands]

<h4>Add Derived</h4>
Opens a dialog box (Figure 20-4) that lets you add a new class to the 
hierarchy. The new class is a derived class of the currently selected 
class, whose name is shown in the dialog box's title. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-4 Create Derived Class dialog box 

<h5>Class name</h5>
Specifies a name for the new class. 


<h5>Header file</h5>
Contains the name of the header file into which the class declaration 
is placed. By default, the first eight characters of the class name (with 
<tt>.h</tt> appended) are used as the header file name. You may type an 
alternative filename into the textbox, or click on Browse to select a 
filename from the <b>Class Header File</b> dialog box. 


<h4>Add Top</h4>
Adds a top-level (baseless) class. The dialog box that opens as a 
result of selecting this command is identical in function to the one 
that opens when you choose the <b>Add Derived</b> command. 


<h4>Add Sibling</h4>
Adds a class that is a sibling of (derived from the same base classes 
as) the currently selected class. The dialog box that opens as a result 
of selecting this command is identical in function to the one that 
opens when you choose the <b>Add Derived</b> command. 

<h4>Show Header</h4>
Opens a new Source window to edit the header file containing the 
declaration of the currently selected class. 


<h4>Connect Base</h4>
Opens the <b>Add Base</b> dialog box (Figure 20-5), with which you can 
add a base class to the selected class. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_5.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-5 Add Base dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>
These options indicate the base class access specifier: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Public:</b> <dd>Public members of the base class are public members of the 
derived class, and protected members of the base class are protected 
members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are 
protected members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are private 
members of the derived class. 
</dl>


<h5>Virtual</h5>
Specifies the base class to be virtual. 


<h5>Base class</h5>
Specifies the class that is made a base of the selected class. You can 
select more than one class to make a base class by holding down the 
Control key while clicking on the class name. 


<h4>Edit Base Attributes</h4>
Opens the <b>Edit Base Attributes</b> dialog box (Figure 20-6), with 
which you can change the attributes of the selected connection 
between a derived class and its base class. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_6.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-6 Edit Base Attributes dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>
These options indicate the base class access specifier: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Public:</b> <dd>Public members of the base class are public members of the 
derived class, and protected members of the base class are protected 
members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are 
protected members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Public and protected members of the base class are private 
members of the derived class. 

<dt><b>Don't change:</b> <dd>Appears only if you are editing the attributes of more 
than one connection and the base class access specifiers are not all 
identical. It means that the base class access specifiers are not 
altered. It lets you change the Virtual specifier of all connections 
without affecting their individual access specifiers. 
</dl>


<h5>Virtual</h5>
If selected, this option specifies the base class to be virtual. If grayed, 
the virtual setting is left unchanged. 


<h4>Delete Base Connection</h4>
Deletes the selected connection between a derived class and its base 
class. 
<p>

You are prompted to confirm this if the Confirm Inheritance Changes 
option on the General page of the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> 
dialog box is selected. 


<h4>Settings</h4>
Opens the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box, in which you set 
global Hierarchy Editor and text editor options. Details of this dialog 
box are discussed in "Hierarchy Editor Settings," later in this chapter. 


<h3>Mouse functions</h3>

The right mouse button opens the pop-up menu. 
<p>

A class is selected by clicking on it. Additional classes may be 
selected by clicking while holding down Control. Members of the 
class last selected appear in the Members child window. 
<p>


Double-clicking on a class opens a Class Editor window. 
A connection is selected by clicking on it. Additional connections 
may be selected by clicking while holding down Control. 
<p>


A new derived class is added by clicking on the base class and 
dragging the cursor to an empty area of the display. 
<p>


A new base-to-derived connection is made by clicking on the base 
class and dragging the cursor to the derived class. 
<p>


A derived class's connection to a base may be moved to a different 
base by clicking the connection, then dragging the connection's 
handle to the new base class. (This is a shortcut for deleting one 
connection, then establishing a new one.) 


<h3>Toolbar commands</h3>

The Hierarchy Editor toolbar (Figure 20-7) offers quick access to 
several menu choices. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_7.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-7 Hierarchy Editor toolbar 
	<p>


The following options are the same as those on other menus: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Add top:</b> <dd>Same as choosing <b>Add Top</b> from the pop-up menu. 

<dt><b>Add derived:</b> <dd>Same as choosing <b>Add Derived</b> from the pop-up 
menu. 

<dt><b>Connect base:</b> <dd>Same as choosing <b>Connect Base</b> from the pop-up

<dt><b>Print:</b> <dd>Same as choosing <b>Print</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu. 

<dt><b>Play macro:</b> <dd>Same as choosing <b>Play</b> from the <b>Macro</b> menu. 
</dl>


<h2>Members Child Window</h2>

The Hierarchy Editor's Members child window is enabled by setting 
the Members option on the Hierarchy page of the
<b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box. You can open this dialog box by 
choosing <b>Settings</b> from the Hierarchy Editor's pop-up menu. 


<h3>Member menu commands</h3>

The Member menu (Figure 20-8) contains commands to add, delete, 
and modify class members, and to access Hierarchy Editor options. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_8.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-8 Member menu commands 

<h4>Add</h4>
Opens the <b>Add Member</b> dialog box (Figure 20-9). The new member 
is added to the class whose members currently are displayed in the 
Members child window. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_9.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-9 Add Member dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>
These options specify the member access control: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Public:</b> <dd>Members are accessible from outside the member's class. 

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Members are accessible only within the member's class, 
derived classes, and their friends. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Members are accessible only within the member's class and 
its friends. 
</dl>


<h5>Storage</h5>
These options specify the member storage class: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Normal:</b> <dd>The member has no storage modifiers. 

<dt><b>Static:</b> <dd>Only one copy of the member exists; it is shared by all 
objects of the member's class. 

<dt><b>Virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function may be overridden in derived 
classes. 

<dt><b>Pure virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function must be overridden in 
derived classes; the class is abstract. 

<dt><b>Friend (functions only):</b> <dd>The named function is allowed access to 
the class's private members. 
</dl>

<h5>Inline</h5>
Requests inline implementation of a function. 


<h5>Declaration</h5>
Contains the member declaration. For data items, enter the type and 
member name (for example, <tt>int nCats</tt>). For functions, enter the 
return type, function name, and argument types (for example, <tt>void 
AddCats(int)</tt>). Do not precede the declaration with storage 
specifiers; use the option buttons above. Trailing semicolons are 
optional. 


<h5>Source file</h5>
Contains the name of the source file into which the member 
definition is placed. By default, the first eight characters of the class 
name (with <tt>.cpp</tt> appended) are used as the source filename. You 
can type an alternative filename into the textbox, or click on Browse 
to select an alternative filename from the <b>Member Source File</b> 
dialog box. 
<p>


The member declaration is placed in the class declaration. If the 
specified source file does not already exist, it is created and added to 
the project. By default, empty definitions of inline functions are 
placed in the header file. Empty definitions of normal, static, and 
virtual functions, as well as static data members, are placed in the 
source file. 


<h4>Delete</h4>
Deletes the currently selected member. If the Confirm Member 
Delete option on the General page of the <b>Editing/Browsing 
Settings</b> dialog box is selected, you are asked to confirm the 
deletion. The member's declaration and definition (if applicable) are 
removed from the header and source files. 


<h4>Edit Attributes</h4>
This command opens the <b>Change Member Attributes</b> dialog box 
(Figure 20-10), which you can use to edit access and storage 
specifiers of the selected member. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure20_10.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 20-10 Change Member Attributes dialog box 

<h5>Access</h5>

<dt><b>Protected:</b> <dd>Members are accessible only within the member's class, 
derived classes, and their friends. 

<dt><b>Private:</b> <dd>Members are accessible only within the member's class and 
its friends. 

<dt><b>Don't change:</b> <dd>Appears only if you are editing the attributes of more 
than one member and their access controls are not all identical. It 
means that the access control is not altered. It lets you change other 
member attributes without also affecting their individual access 
controls. 
</dl>


<h5>Storage</h5>
These options specify the member storage class: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Normal:</b> <dd>The member has no storage modifiers. 

<dt><b>Static:</b> <dd>Only one copy of the member exists; it is shared by all 
objects of the member's class. 

<dt><b>Virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function may be overridden in derived 
classes. 

<dt><b>Pure virtual (functions only):</b> <dd>The function must be overridden; the 
class is abstract. 

<dt><b>Friend (functions only):</b> <dd>The named function is allowed access to 
the class's protected and private members. 

<dt><b>Don't change:</b> <dd>Appears only if you are editing the attributes of more 
than one member and their storage classes are not all identical. It 
means that the storage class is not altered. It lets you change other 
member attributes without affecting their individual storage classes. 
</dl>


<h5>Inline</h5>
Requests inline implementation of a function. If grayed, the current 
setting is left unchanged. 


<h5>Source file</h5>
If applicable, this option contains the name of the source file holding 
the member definition. You may change the filename in the textbox, 
or click on Browse to select an alternative filename from the 
<b>Member Source File</b> dialog box. If you change the source file, the 
member definition moves. 


<h4>Show Source</h4>
Opens a new Source window to show the source file containing the 
definition of the currently selected member. 
<p>


If you add new functions or static data definitions to the source file, 
or alter function argument or return types, you must update the class 
header to reflect the changes. 


<h4>Settings</h4>
Opens the <b>Editing/Browsing Settings</b> dialog box, in which you set 
global Hierarchy Editor and text editor options. Details of this dialog 
box are discussed in "Hierarchy Editor Settings," later in this chapter. 


<h3>Pop-up menu commands</h3>

The Members child window pop-up menu is identical to the 
<b>Member</b> menu. 


<h3>Mouse functions</h3>

The right mouse button opens the pop-up menu. 
<p>

Select a member by clicking on it. Additional members may be 
selected by clicking on them while holding down Control. 
<p>

Double-clicking on a member causes its definition (if appropriate) or 
declaration to be displayed in the Source child window. 
<p>

You may drag and drop a member into the Source child window; the 
member declaration is inserted into the buffer. 


<h2>Source Child Window</h2>

The Hierarchy Editor's Source child window is enabled by setting the 
Source option on the Hierarchy page of the <b>Editing/Browsing 
Settings</b> dialog box. You can open this dialog box by choosing 
<b>Settings</b> from the Hierarchy Editor's pop-up menu. 


<h3>Edit menu commands</h3>

Commands in the <b>Edit</b> menu (Figure 20-11) are used to perform text 
editing operations, and are identical to the corresponding <b>Edit</b> menu 
commands in Source windows. For a description, see Chapter 21, 
"Text Editor Reference." 

	<p>
