<h1>22. Using Version Control</h1>


The IDDE's Version Control System (VCS) allows programmers to
work safely with the same source files simultaneously, integrate
their changes, rebuild their own sources, and store updated master
files in a common master archive. 
<p>

The VCS works in combination with INTERSOLV's PVCS, a popular 
version control program for the PC. However, VCS offers significant 
functional improvements over PVCS alone, because it is integrated 
with the IDDE's project system and has access to information stored 
in the project (<tt>.prj</tt>) file. Digital Mars's VCS guards against 
accidentally overwriting changes made by others and provides the 
highest level of support possible for keeping both your private 
project directory and the master project directory fully synchronized. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
If you do not have PVCS, you need to purchase it 
from INTERSOLV before you can use Digital Mars's 
VCS. See the PVCS documentation for information 
on PVCS features and commands. 
<p>


This chapter assumes a knowledge of PVCS and a familiarity with 
basic version control concepts. The chapter focuses on using the 
group-oriented model of software development that VCS makes 
possible, and it explains how to use VCS to build and maintain 
projects. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
The IDDE's Version Control System (VCS) 
is supported only in the 16-bit version of 
Digital Mars C++. 


<h2>Overview of VCS Concepts</h2>

This section defines basic terms used in this chapter and compares 
the parallel model of version control to the linear model supported 
by other version control systems. 
<p>


The next section, "Setting Up Version Control with VCS," presents an 
overview of how you or your project team can use VCS to establish 
and maintain version control on software development projects of 
any size. 


<h3>Terminology</h3>

The following terms are used throughout this chapter: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Archive (or master archive):</b> <dd>All revisions of a source file, 
stored in a commonly accessible directory structure, 
usually on a network. 

<dt><b>Revision:</b> <dd>A revised archived source file that has a 
revision number and timestamp that identifies when the 
revision was created. 

<dt><b>Workfile:</b> <dd>Your private copy of the revision that you are 
currently working on. 

<dt><b>Private project directory:</b> <dd>Your personal working 
directory to which others do not have access. You work 
with workfiles in your private project directory. 

<dt><b>GET:</b> <dd>The process of obtaining a private copy of a 
revision of an archive (usually the latest revision). 

<dt><b>MERGE:</b> <dd>The process of collating changes to a revision 
into the archive, without overwriting or corrupting any 
changes made by others since you got the revision. 

<dt><b>PUT:</b> <dd>The process of creating a new revision of a file in 
the archive. 

<dt><b>Version:</b> <dd>A group of revisions containing all source files 
that make up a project. Typically you create versions to 
correspond to milestones in the development process, 
such as the weekly build or the beta build. 
</dl>

<h3>Version control models</h3>

There are two basic models for version control: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Linear:</b> <dd>Only one person can work with a file at any one 
time. 

<dt><b>Parallel:</b> <dd>Groups of people can work with the same set of 
files simultaneously. 
</dl>

Most version control systems support a linear model of version 
control. In practice, few support a parallel version control system 
because additional support is required to prevent losing changes. 
The Digital Mars C++ IDDE, however, fully supports the parallel model. 


<h2>Setting Up Version Control with VCS</h2>


This section gives you an overview of how you can use VCS on your 
software development project. The remainder of the chapter 
explains how to use VCS to perform the operations introduced here. 


<h3>Using the linear model with VCS</h3>

In the linear model, VCS locks a revision when someone GETs it; 
that is, VCS prevents others from making a private copy. Thus, only 
one person may work with a revision at a time. It is even possible to 
lock all revisions that make up a particular version. 
<p>


After changing the revision, the person who receives it must PUT it 
back into the master archive before others can make changes to it. 
<p>


The advantage of the linear method of version control is that you do 
not have to collate (merge) sets of changes to a revision. The 
obvious disadvantage is that only one person can work on a file at a 
time. In large development projects in which many people are 
making changes to related groups of files, this model is often 
unworkable. 


<h3>Using the parallel model with VCS</h3>

The parallel version control model allows two or more people to 
work simultaneously with copies of the same revision— a clear 
advantage even in a small work group. The disadvantage of this 
model is that each person's changes must be merged with changes 
made by others, so the master archive of a revision incorporates 
everyone's work and the related changes made to other files 
(sometimes called "dependencies"). 
<p>


When working in a parallel version control environment, the 
revisions and versions used by the development team are stored in a 
master archive, usually on a network. Developers GET a revision (or 
more typically a group of related revisions) from the master archive 
and work with the copies (workfiles) in their own private project 
directory. 
<p>


After making changes to a group of workfiles, developers must 
MERGE their changes into the latest version of revisions of the files. 
This is done in the private project directory because it often involves 
identifying changes made by others in the interim, along with 
resolving dependencies in other revisions that were affected by other 
people's changes. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
In your revised file, be sure to identify the revision 
with which you want your changes merged. You 
make this reference by adding a <tt>$revision</tt> entry 
in the file. 
<p>


When changes are merged successfully, and all related changes have 
been made to affected revisions in the private project directory, each 
developer PUTs the new revisions back into the master archive. 
<p>


If a revision has been modified during the MERGE, it must be 
remerged before it can be PUT into the archive. VCS warns you of 
this automatically and gives you a way to prevent other people from 
merging changes into the archived version of a revision until you 
have successfully PUT it. 
<p>


The parallel model also supports branching of revisions. When you 
create a branch of a revision, you can PUT it back into the archive 
without performing a MERGE. This allows others to GET your 
changes to a revision. You use the branching mechanism if you want 
a set of changes available to you but you do not want to MERGE the 
changes until your work is complete. For more information, see 
"Creating a new branch," later in this chapter. 


<h2>Setting VCS Options</h2>

This section explains how to use the options in the VCS page of the 
<b>Project Settings</b> dialog box to set up version control parameters 
that specify the rules VCS follows when you GET and PUT files. 
<p>

To open this dialog box, open the project you want to work with, 
and choose <b>Settings</b> from the IDDE's <b>Project</b> menu. In the <b>Project</b> 
<b>Settings</b> dialog box, select the <b>VCS</b> tab. The <b>VCS</b> page is shown in 
Figure 22-1. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure22_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 22-1 VCS page in Project Settings dialog box 

<h3>Choosing a Development Model</h3>

The Development Model radio buttons specify the development 
model that VCS uses. Select the Parallel model, described earlier in 
this chapter, unless you are the only person working on the files in a 
project. 
<p>


Select Linear if you are working alone, or if you need to deny other 
developers access to revisions you are working on. 
<p>


You can switch from the parallel to the linear mode when, for 
example, you need to prohibit GET operations on revisions you are 
merging (see "Merge Options," later in this chapter). 
<p>


The IDDE sets the rest of the VCS options for you, based on the 
development model you select, as described later in this chapter. If 
you need more control over the version control process, you may 
change the default settings. This is not usually necessary. 


<h3>Get Options</h3>

These options specify how VCS handles your requests to GET 
revisions from the master archive: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Get read only:</b> <dd>Lets you GET files from the master archive, but with 
read only access; you cannot modify the files you GET. Check this 
option if you want to view a revision (for example, an old revision), 
or if you want to ensure that you do not accidentally change the 
files. This option is off by default in both development models. 

<dt><b>Get and lock:</b> <dd>Prevents others from successfully executing a GET 
operation on a revision once you GET it. The revision remains 
locked until you PUT it back in the archive again. This option is on 
by default when you choose the Linear development model. 

<dt><b>Get and touch:</b> <dd>Sets the time-stamp for any revision you GET to the 
current date and time. This setting forces recompilation of your files. 
It is off by default in both development models. 

<dt><b>Continue on overwrite error:</b> <dd>Tells the IDDE to overwrite a file on 
a GET operation without displaying a warning. Use this setting to 
wipe out all changes you have made to a revision and GET a new 
copy from the master archives. This option is off by default in both 
development models. 
</dl>

<h3>Merge Options</h3>

The Lock Master File on Merge Setting prohibits others from 
executing a PUT operation on a revision in the master archive while 
you are performing a MERGE on it. This option is off by default in 
both development models. 


<h2>Creating a VCS Configuration File</h2>

A VCS configuration file defines a series of variables that tell VCS 
where to look for and create files. You can create a VCS 
configuration (<tt>.cfg</tt>) file with the integrated editor or any other text 
editor. You need a <tt>.cfg</tt> file for each project in which you use VCS. 
<p>


A sample configuration file, <tt>vcs.cfg</tt>, comes with Digital Mars C++. 
(It is installed in <tt>\dm\samples\windows\wclock</tt> by default.) 
The sample <tt>vcs.cfg</tt> contains information that VCS needs to work: 


<dl>
<dt><b><tt>vcsdir:</tt></b> <dd>The directory in which VCS stores master 
archives. This variable must be defined for VCS to work. 
(All others are optional and default to the current 
directory.) 

<dt><b><tt>journal:</tt></b> <dd>The file name and path in which VCS creates 
a journal (<tt>journal.vcs</tt>) that contains the information 
about changes to revisions in an archive. 

<dt><b><tt>archivework:</tt></b> <dd>The directory in which VCS keeps 
backup copies of revisions as they are updated. (This 
command corresponds to the LOGWORK command in 
older versions of PVCS.) Do not specify a RAM disk as 
the ARCHIVEWORK directory. 

<dt><b>workdir:</b> <dd>The VCS temporary directory. 
</dl>

It is a good idea to give the <tt>.cfg</tt> file for a project the same name as 
the project itself and to save it in your private project directory. 


<h3>Selecting the configuration file</h3>

Before you use VCS for the first time on a project, you need to select 
the configuration file for the project: 

<ol>
	<li> In the Project window, choose <b>Configuration</b> from the 
	<b>VCS</b> menu. The <b>Set VCS Configuration</b> dialog box 
	opens. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure22_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 22-2 Set VCS Configuration dialog box 
	<p>

	<li> Select the configuration file you want and click OK. You 
	need to specify its location if it is not in the current 
	directory. 
</ol>

<h3>The PVCS Registration dialog box</h3>

The first time you open the <b>Set VCS Configuration</b> dialog box, the 
<b>PVCS Registration</b> dialog box is displayed. You must have an 
INTERSOLV LAF (License Administration Facility) code to use PVCS 
in the IDDE. INTERSOLV supplies the LAF code to licensed users. 
For more information, please contact INTERSOLV. Type the code in 
the License Code textbox, then click OK to continue. After the <b>PVCS 
Registration</b> dialog box disappears, a message informs you that you 
must restart Windows. 
<p>


The User database directory textbox shows the database directory in 
which the license database is placed. This directory should be a 
shared directory on the network if multiple developers are using the 
same copy of the IDDE from the network. If developers have 
individual copies of the IDDE, do not change the text in this box. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
If you have PVCS version 5.0 or later, the IDDE 
does not display the <b>PVCS Registration</b> dialog box. 


<h2>Putting Revisions into the Archive</h2>

When you PUT a revision in the master archive, VCS updates its 
revision number and time stamp and marks it as "not changed" with 
respect to the corresponding workfile in your private project 
directory. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
If, while you were performing a MERGE, another 
person has PUT a new revision of a file you want to 
PUT, VCS warns you with a modal dialog box that 
you must perform another MERGE operation on the 
revision. 
<p>

To prevent others from working on a revision while 
you are merging it, check Lock Master File on 
Merge. See the section "Merge Options," earlier in 
this chapter, for more information. 
<p>


To begin a PUT operation, choose <b>Put</b> from the Project window's 
<b>VCS</b> menu. The <b>Put</b> dialog box is displayed. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure22_3.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 22-3 Put dialog box 
	<p>

The Put Candidate Files listbox shows those workfiles in your private 
project directory that have changed since you checked them out. 
Click the Add button to add files from this list to the Files to Put 
Back listbox; this shows the files you want to PUT into the master 
archive. To remove a revision from the Files to Put Back list, select it 
and click on Remove. 
<p>


Click on Select All to select all files in the current listbox. Click on 
Unselect All to deselect them. 
<p>


Select a file name and click on View Log for a summary of who 
changed the latest revision of that file and the changes that were 
made. 
<p>


To associate comments with all selected files in the Files to Put Back 
listbox, type them into the Comments textbox. 
<p>


Click on Put to PUT the files listed in the Files to Put Back listbox 
into the master archive. 
<p>


Click on the Advanced button and the <b>Put</b> dialog box expands to 
show additional options. 
<p>


When you PUT files into the archives, you can specify a group of 
files using the Put Special textboxes. The Put Special options are: 


<dl>
<dt><b>Revision:</b> <dd>Specifies the revision number you want to give the 
workfiles you are putting into the archives. The revision number has 
the format <i>nn.xx</i>, where <i>nn</i> is the major number and <i>xx</i> is the minor 
number. The numbers can range from 0 to 65,535. 
<p>


If you do not explicitly assign a revision number to a revision, VCS 
assigns one automatically by incrementing the minor number of the 
most recent revision by one. 


<dt><b>Version:</b> <dd>Assigns the name you want to a group of revisions, such as 
beta or alpha. VCS associates the version name with all revisions 
listed in the Files To Put Back listbox. 


<dt><b>Date/Time:</b> <dd>The date and time of a version or revision you archive. 
The default date format is <i>mmm/dd/yy</i>; <i>mmm</i> is the month, dd the 
day, and yy the year. The time format is <i>hh</i>[:<i>mm</i>[:<i>ss</i>]]; <i>hh</i> is the hour, 
<i>mm</i> is the minute, and <i>ss</i> is the second. 
</dl>

<h3>Creating a new branch</h3>

Use the Create New Branch option to maintain a private set of 
revisions in the master archives without having to MERGE them. 
When you have a private branch, you can change a file and perform 
PUT operations as often as necessary, without affecting other 
developers. 
<p>


When you are ready, you can MERGE your private revisions back 
into the master archive. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
A MERGE is the only way to make the changes in a 
branch available to other developers. 


<h2>Getting Revisions from an Archive</h2>

Before you can work with archived revisions, you need to GET them 
from the archive and copy them to your private project directory 
using the <b>Get</b> dialog box, shown in Figure 22-4. (Both the archive 
directory and your private project directory are specified in the VCS 
configuration file for the project.) 
<p>


When you GET a revision from an archive, VCS records the revision 
identification numbers of the files, marks them as unchanged and 
not new, and adds them to your project (if you so specify in the <b>Get</b> 
dialog box). 
<p>


If you are using the linear development model, VCS locks the 
archived revisions when you GET them so nobody else can GET 
them until you PUT them back. If you are using the parallel model, 
more than one developer can check out the revision unless you 
specify Get and Lock on the VCS page in the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog 
box. 
<p>


To GET revisions from the master archive: 

<ol>
	<li> In the Project window, choose <b>Get</b> from the <b>VCS</b> menu. 
	The <b>Get</b> dialog box is displayed. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure22_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 22-4 Get dialog box 
	<p>

	<li> The VCS File Name listbox shows the names of all 
	revisions in the archive. Select from this list the files you 
	want to move to your private project directory. 
	<p>

	To add one or more files, click on the file name(s), then 
	click on the Add button. To add all files in the archive, 
	click on the Select All button. VCS moves the files you 
	select to the Work Files listbox. 
	<p>

	To view a summary of who made certain changes to a 
	revision, click on View Log. (This is the same log that is 
	available from the <b>Merge</b> dialog box.) 

	<li> When all the files you want are in the Work Files list, 
	click the Get button. VCS copies those files to your 
	private project directory. 
	<p>

	To remove files from the Work Files list, click on the file 
	name(s), then click on the Remove button. 
</ol>


Click on the Advanced button to display the following additional 
options: Show Archives, Get Special, and Add Files to Project. 
<p>


Show Archives provides the following settings: 

<dl>
<dt><b>All archives:</b> <dd>Displays all archives in the VCS File Name listbox. This 
is the default setting. 

<dt><b>New archives:</b> <dd>Displays in the VCS File Name listbox the names of 
the new archives and archives that have changed since the last time 
you performed a GET operation. Choose this option to update your 
private copy of the project with the most current revision(s). 

<dt><b>Except merges:</b> <dd>Displays in the VCS File Name listbox all the new 
revisions in the archive except those you just merged or need to 
merge. Select this option to choose only those additional archives 
you need to build and to test merged revisions. 
<p>

The Add Files to Project option adds the revisions automatically to 
the current project when VCS gets them from the archive. 
<p>


To retrieve a specific revision or version, use the Get Special 
textboxes: 

<dl>
	<dt><b>Revision:</b> <dd>is the number of the revision you want to get 
	from the archives. The revision number has the format 
	<i>nn.xx</i>, where <i>nn</i> is the major number and <i>xx</i> is the 
	minor number. 

	<dt><b>Version:</b> <dd>is the name of the version you want to GET. The 
	version name identifies a particular version, such as 
	alpha or beta. 

	<dt><b>Date/Time:</b> <dd>is the date and time of a particular version or 
	revision. The default date format is <i>mmm/dd/yy; mmm</i> is 
	the month, <i>dd</i> the day, and <i>yy</i> the year. The time format 
	is <i>hh</i>[:<i>mm</i>[:<i>ss</i>]]; where <i>hh</i> is the hour, <i>mm</i> is the minute, 
	and <i>ss</i> is the second. 
</dl>
</dl>


<h2>Merging Revisions</h2>

If you are working with the parallel development model, after you 
GET a revision and make changes to it, you may need to MERGE 
those changes into the master archive. The master archive 
presumably contains changes made by others that your revision does 
not include. If no other developer has changed the file, then you do 
not need to MERGE; you simply PUT the new revision in the master 
archive. 
<p>


<b>Note:</b> 
Remember that in your revised file, you must refer 
to the revision with which you want your changes 
merged. You do this by adding a <tt>$revision</tt> entry 
in the file. 
<p>


When you MERGE a revision, VCS creates a backup of your revision 
in your private project directory. In addition, VCS provides all 
possible support for performing MERGE operations safely. 
<p>


To merge your changes into another revision in the archive, choose 
<b>Merge</b> from the Project window's <b>VCS</b> menu. The <b>Merge</b> dialog box 
opens.

	<p>


The <b>Merge</b> dialog box contains four listboxes: 

<dl>
<dt><b>Files you modified:</b> <dd>Shows the files you modified in your private 
project directory since the last time you performed a GET operation. 

<dt><b>Files new in VCS:</b> <dd>Shows archives that someone else has changed 
since the last time you performed a GET operation. The current 
(most recent) revision number is displayed. These are files you might 
need to GET to rebuild the project with your changes and to PUT 
your new revisions back into the archive. 

<dt><b>Files to merge:</b> <dd>Shows files that both you and another person 
changed since the last time you performed a GET operation. These 
are the workfiles you need to MERGE. 

<dt><b>Merged files:</b> <dd>Shows files that you merged during the current 
MERGE session. 
</dl>


To display a log showing who changed an archive and what changes 
were made at each revision, click on a file name in one of the 
listboxes and click on the View Log button. See the PVCS 
documentation for information on the display format. 
<p>


Click the View Changes button to show the changes you need to 
resolve when you MERGE the selected revision. When you click 
View Changes, an annotated change file appears in an IDDE editor 
window. See the PVCS documentation for information on the format 
of the display and the meanings of symbols. 
<p>


When you are ready to perform the MERGE operation, click on 
Merge. VCS guides you through a three-way merge, incorporating 
your changes and those made by others into a new revision. 
<p>


Because the IDDE automatically makes backup copies of both the 
revision in your private project directory and the revision you want 
to MERGE it with, you can undo a MERGE (before closing the <b>Merge</b> 
dialog box) by clicking Undo Merge. 


<h3>Testing the MERGE operation</h3>

To test the MERGE, return to the <b>Get</b> dialog box, click on Advanced, 
and select Except Merges. GET the files in this list and build them 
using the IDDE (see Chapter 8, "Testing an Application," for 
information). 


<h2>Using the VCS Manager</h2>

Use the VCS Manager for additional flexibility in managing revisions 
and versions. You can apply a version name to a set of archives 
when the software reaches a significant release step, such as beta or 
final release. You can also delete a named version or revision from 
an archive. Before deleting a version or revision, make sure that you 
are deleting the right one, as a deleted version or revision cannot be 
recovered. Finally, the VCS manager lets you lock or unlock a 
version or revision. 
<p>


To use the VCS Manager in the Project window, choose <b>Manager</b> 
from the <b>VCS</b> menu. 
<p>


The <b>VCS Manager</b> dialog box shown in Figure 22-6 is displayed. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure22_6.gif">

	[Figure 22-6 VCS Manager dialog box 
	<p>

<b>Note:</b> 
You probably will not need to use the <b>VCS 
Manager</b> dialog box on most projects. 
<p>


The VCS Directory listbox contains the names of revisions to add to a 
version or revision. Double-click on the file name to add it to the 
Selected Files listbox. Click on Select All to select all files. 
<p>


To assign a version name, type the name, such as beta, in the 
Version textbox, and click on the Assign button. This assigns the 
version name to all files in Selected Files. The Assign and Unassign 
buttons are available only if you specify a version name in the 
Version textbox. 
<p>


To control access to a particular version or revision, specify the 
revision (its number) or version (its name) in the appropriate 
textbox, then click on Lock to deny access or Unlock to allow 
access. 
<p>


To delete a version or revision, specify the appropriate information 
in the Revision or Version textbox, and click on the Delete button. 


<h2>Creating a Master Archive</h2>

When you begin using VCS, it may be your job to create the master 
archive to and from which others GET and PUT files. This section 
describes the process of creating a master archive. 
<p>


The master archive contains the revisions to all source files in a 
project. It also records information about changes from the previous 
revision, a history of the changes since the first revision, a record of 
who changed the files, the comments attached to the revisions as 
they were changed, and the date and time that each revision was 
PUT into the archive. See the PVCS documentation for additional 
information. 
<p>


To set up a master archive, you PUT the workfiles in your project 
directory in the archives using the <b>Put</b> command. This command 
takes files from the original directory and creates the archives 
automatically. See "Using the VCS Manager," earlier in this chapter, 
for more information on the <b>Put</b> dialog box and how to 
use it. 
<p>


When you PUT files in an archive, VCS changes their extensions 
automatically. The last character of the extension on each file is 
changed to V. For example, the file extension on <tt>abc.cpp</tt> becomes 
<tt>abc.cpv</tt>. If the file does not have an extension, VCS adds the 
extension <tt>.__v</tt> to the filename (two underscores and a v). 
<p>


To create a master archive from the workfiles in your private project 
directory: 

<ol>
	<li> Choose <b>Put</b> from the <b>VCS</b> menu in the Project window. 

	<li> PUT the workfiles from your private project directory 
	into the archive by double-clicking on the file in the Put 
	Candidate Files listbox. 
	<p>

	The Put Candidate Files listbox displays the names of 
	workfiles that you changed since the last time you 
	performed a GET operation. The listbox also shows the 
	files that do not yet have archives. Because you are 
	creating the archives, all files in the project are displayed. 
	Files you select are added to the Files To Put Back 
	listbox. 

	<li> To add all your workfiles to the master archive, click on 
	Select All. To remove a workfile from the list of files to 
	archive, select the file in the Files To Put Back list and 
	click on the Remove button. 

	<li> Optional: Type a comment in the Comments textbox. 
	VCS applies your comment to all selected files in the 
	Files to Put Back listbox. 

	<li> Click the Put button to create the master archives and 
	PUT your workfiles in them. 
</ol>
