<h1>28. Bitmap, Cursor, Icon, and Font Editors</h1>


This ResourceStudio reference chapter contains details about the 
commands and options found in the Bitmap editor, the Cursor 
editor, the Icon editor, and the Font editor. For an introduction to 
ResourceStudio, see Chapter 7, "Adding Look and Feel with 
Resources." 
<p>

This chapter shows the editors running in standalone windows. If 
you edit a binary resource directly (that is, if you open or create it by 
choosing <b>Open</b> from the Shell window's <b>File</b> menu), the File menu 
you will see will not match those shown below, and the ID and File 
fields in the Property sheet will be disabled.

<a name="bitmapeditor"><h2>Bitmap Editor</h2></a>

The Bitmap editor (see Figure 28-1) is used to edit bitmaps. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_1.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-1 The Bitmap editor 
	<p>

The Bitmap editor displays two views of the bitmap. Each view can 
be independently zoomed; you may wish to keep one view at 
normal size for reference, and one at a higher magnification for 
easier drawing. You can draw in either view, though. 
<p>


Drawing tools are selected by choosing commands in the <b>Tool</b> 
menu, or by clicking on the tool in the toolbox. Colors are selected 
in the palette section of the toolbox. The <b>View</b> menu is used to 
zoom the views and to turn on the grid. Simple image manipulation 
functions are available in the <b>Image</b> menu. 
<p>


For more information about using the Bitmap editor, see Chapter 7, 
"Adding Look and Feel with Resources." 


<h3>BitmapExpress</h3>

As a new bitmap is created, the <b>BitmapExpress</b> dialog box opens 
(see Figure 28-2). This dialog box is used to set initial bitmap 
properties. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_2.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-2 BitmapExpress 

<h4>Select bitmap type</h4>
Specifies the number of colors in the bitmap (2, 16, or 256). 


<h4>Initial size</h4>
Specifies the bitmap width and height. 


<h4>Toolbar bitmap</h4>
Select this option if the bitmap will be used as the toolbar in an MFC 
application. If this option is selected, the number of colors is set to 
16 and the initial size is determined by the value of the Buttons 
across option. 


<h4>Buttons across</h4>
Specifies the number of buttons for toolbar bitmaps. The bitmap's 
initial size is changed to accommodate the number of buttons you 
request. Each button is 15 pixels high and 16 pixels across. 


<h3>File menu commands</h3>

The <b>File</b> menu (see Figure 28-3) contains commands to save the 
resource file, to edit resource IDs, and to perform other 
miscellaneous functions. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_3.gif">
	<p>

	<dt><b>ClassExpress</b>
	<dd>Runs ClassExpress, passing the filename of the resource file as the 
	project that ClassExpress should open. This command is only 
	enabled if the Bitmap editor is running in the right pane of the 
	Browser window. 

	<dt><b>Class Editing</b>
	<dd>Closes the Bitmap editor. 
</dl>


<h3>Edit menu commands</h3>

The <b>Edit</b> menu (see Figure 28-4) contains standard editing 
commands. You can undo operations, and can cut, copy, paste, and 
clear rectangular regions of the bitmap. To select a region to cut, 
copy, or clear, select the Selection tool from the toolbox or from the 
Tool menu, then drag a box around the region. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_4.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-4 Bitmap editor Edit menu

	dragged to a new location. 

	<dt><b>Clear</b>
	<dd>Clears the selected region, filling it with the current background 
	color. If no region is selected, the entire bitmap is cleared. 
</dl>

<h3>View menu commands</h3>

The View menu (see Figure 28-5) contains commands to set view 
magnification and to set grid options. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_5.gif">

	Turns on display of the pixel grid. 

	<h5>Button grid</h5>
	Turns on display of the button grid. The spacing of points on the 
	button grid can be specified in the Width and Height fields; defaults 
	for an MFC application toolbar are 16 pixels wide by 15 pixels high. 
</dl>

<h3>Tool menu commands</h3>

The <b>Tool</b> menu (see Figure 28-7) lets you select drawing tools. 
While over the drawing area, the cursor changes shape to indicate 
the currently selected tool. To draw, click or click and drag (as 
appropriate) in the drawing area. Using the right button rather than 
the left reverses the roles of foreground and background colors. 
Drawing tools can also be selected in the toolbox. For more 
information about drawing operations in the Bitmap editor, see 
Chapter 7, "Adding Look and Feel with Resources."

<h3>Toolbox</h3>

The Bitmap editor toolbox (see Figure 28-10) provides quick access 
to the tools available in the <b>Tool</b> menu. The toolbox also lets you 
select foreground and background colors, brush types, background 
pattern, and line type. 
<p>


For more information on the Bitmap editor toolbox, see Chapter 7, 
"Adding Look and Feel with Resources." 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_10.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-10 Bitmap editor toolbox 

<h3>Bitmap properties</h3>

Bitmaps have two pages of properties. The General properties are 
shown in Figure 28-11. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_11.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-11 Bitmap General properties 
	<p>


Specify a filename for the bitmap in the File textbox. The Width and 
Height of the bitmap can be changed here, or the bitmap can be 
resized in the main display by dragging one of the handles along the 
bitmap edge. 
<p>


Palette properties of a bitmap are shown in Figure 28-12. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_12.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-12 Bitmap Palette properties 
	<p>

Foreground and background drawing colors can be set by 
respectively clicking and right-clicking colors in this display. Double-clicking 
a color opens the <b>Custom Color</b> dialog box, which can be 
used to change the color's red, green, and blue components. 


<hr>
<a name="cursoreditor"><h2>Cursor Editor</h2></a>

The Cursor editor (see Figure 28-13) is used to edit cursors. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_13.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-13 The Cursor editor 
	<p>

Since cursors are much like bitmaps, the Cursor editor behaves much 
like the Bitmap editor (see "Bitmap Editor," earlier in this chapter). 
The distinguishing characteristics of cursors are as follows: 

<ul>
<li> A cursor resource may contain more than one cursor. 
ResourceStudio lets you create up to four different 
cursors in a cursor resource. The four possible cursor 
types have predefined sizes and color depths. 

<li> In addition to normal colors, cursors can have areas 
which are tagged "Transparent" and "Inverted." In 
Transparent areas, the background screen color shows 
through the cursor. In Inverted areas, the background 
screen color is bitwise-complemented. 

<li> Cursors have a "hotspot," a particular pixel which is used 
by Windows to map the cursor to a screen location. 
</ul>

The Cursor editor displays two views of the cursor. Each view can be 
independently zoomed; you may wish to keep one view at normal 
size for reference, and one at a higher magnification for easier 
drawing. You can draw in either view, though. 
<p>


Drawing tools are selected by choosing commands in the <b>Tool</b> 
menu, or by clicking on the tool in the toolbox. Colors are selected 
in the palette section of the toolbox. The <b>View</b> menu is used to 
zoom the views and to turn on the grid. Simple image manipulation 
functions are available in the <b>Image</b> menu. The cursor hotspot is set 
by choosing <b>Set Hotspot</b> from the <b>Image</b> menu. 


<h3>File menu commands</h3>

The <b>File</b> menu (see Figure 28-14) contains commands to save the 
resource file, to edit resource IDs, and to perform other 
miscellaneous functions. 

	<p>

<h3>Image menu commands</h3>

Commands in the <b>Image</b> menu (see Figure 28-19) perform simple 
image manipulation functions. To select a region to flip or invert, 
select the Selection tool from the toolbox or from the <b>Tool</b> menu, 
then drag a box around the region. If no region is selected, these 
commands operate on the entire cursor. This menu also contains a 
command to set the cursor hotspot.

<h3>Toolbox</h3>

The Cursor editor toolbox (see Figure 28-21) provides quick access 
to the tools available in the <b>Tool</b> menu. The toolbox also lets you 
select foreground and background colors, brush types, background 
pattern, and line type. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_21.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-21 Cursor editor toolbox 
	<p>

The toolbox is slightly different from the toolbox used in the Bitmap 
editor. In addition to the usual color palette, two extra colors are 
available: Transparent and Inverted. Transparent is used to draw 
areas in the cursor where the background screen color shows 
through. Inverted is used to draw areas in the cursor where the 
background screen color is bitwise-complemented. 
<p>


Other than these two additions, the Cursor editor toolbox is identical 
to the Bitmap editor toolbox. For more information on the Bitmap 
editor toolbox, see Chapter 7, "Adding Look and Feel with 
Resources." 


<h3>Cursor properties</h3>

Cursor properties are shown in Figure 28-22. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_22.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-22 Cursor properties 
	<p>

Specify a filename for the cursor resource in the File textbox. The 
cursor hotspot coordinates are displayed below the File textbox. The 
Image field specifies which of the cursors in the cursor resource is 
currently displayed. Click on New to create a new cursor in the 
current resource, or click on Delete to delete the current cursor from 
the resource. Note that you cannot delete the last cursor from the 
resource. 


<hr>
<a name="iconeditor"><h2>Icon Editor</h2></a>

The Icon editor (see Figure 28-23) is used to edit icons. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_23.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-23 The Icon editor 
	<p>

Since icons are much like bitmaps, the Icon editor behaves much 
like the Bitmap editor (see "Bitmap Editor," earlier in this chapter). 
The distinguishing characteristics of icons are as follows: 


<ul>
<li> An icon resource may contain more than one icon. 
ResourceStudio lets you create up to twelve different 
icons in an icon resource. You can create 32 by 16, 32 by 
32, 16 by 16, and 64 by 64 pixel icons in 2, 8, 16, and 256 
colors. 

<li> In addition to normal colors, icons can have areas which 
are tagged "Transparent" and "Inverted." In Transparent 
areas, the background screen color shows through the 
icon. In Inverted areas, the background screen color is 
bitwise-complemented. 
</ul>

The Icon editor displays two views of the icon. Each view can be 
independently zoomed; you may wish to keep one view at normal 
size for reference, and one at a higher magnification for easier 
drawing. You can draw in either view, though. 
<p>


Drawing tools are selected by choosing commands in the <b>Tool</b> 
menu, or by clicking on the tool in the toolbox. Colors are selected 
in the palette section of the toolbox. The <b>View</b> menu is used to 
zoom the views and to turn on the grid. Simple image manipulation 
functions are available in the <b>Image</b> menu. 


<h3>File menu commands</h3>

The <b>File</b> menu (see Figure 28-24) contains commands to save the 
resource file, to edit resource IDs, and to perform other 
miscellaneous functions.

	<dd>Closes the Icon editor. 
</dl>


<h3>Edit menu commands</h3>

The <b>Edit</b> menu (see Figure 28-25) contains standard editing 
commands. You can undo operations, and can cut, copy, paste, and 
clear rectangular regions of the icon. To select a region to cut, copy, 
or clear, select the Selection tool from the toolbox or from the <b>Tool</b> 
menu, then drag a box around the region.

<h3>Tool menu commands</h3>

The <b>Tool</b> menu (see Figure 28-28) lets you select drawing tools. 
While over the drawing area, the cursor changes shape to indicate 
the currently selected tool. To draw, click or click and drag (as 
appropriate) in the drawing area. Using the right button rather than 
the left reverses the roles of foreground and background colors. 
Drawing tools can also be selected in the toolbox. Drawing 
operations are identical to those in the Bitmap editor.

<hr>
<a name="fonteditor"><h2>Font Editor</h2></a>

The Font editor (see Figure 28-33) is used to edit font resources. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_33.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-33 The Font editor 
	<p>

Unlike the Bitmap editor, the two views in the Font editor are not 
equivalent. The left pane displays each of the character bitmaps in 
the font at normal size. To select a bitmap for editing, click on it in 
the left pane. The current bitmap is edited in the right pane, which 
functions in the same way as a pane in the Bitmap editor. 
<p>


Otherwise, the Font editor functions much like the Bitmap editor. 
Drawing tools are selected by choosing commands in the <b>Tool</b> 
menu, or by clicking on the tool in the toolbox. Colors are selected 
in the palette section of the toolbox (font bitmaps are monochrome, 
so only two colors are available). The <b>View</b> menu is used to zoom 
the editing view and to turn on the grid. Simple image manipulation 
functions are available in the <b>Image</b> menu. 


<h3>FontExpress</h3>

As a new font is created, the <b>FontExpress</b> dialog box opens (see 
Figure 28-34). This dialog box is used to set initial font properties. 

	<p>
	<img align="middle" src="figure28_34.gif">
	<p>
	[Figure 28-34 FontExpress

The most important option to specify is the point size. While most of 
the other options can be easily changed at a later time, a change in 
the font height may require redrawing any characters you have 
drawn so far. All of the character bitmaps in the font have the same 
height. 
<p>


The Proportional option enables
setting the horizontal size of each character independently.

commands operate on the entire character bitmap.

<h3>Toolbox</h3>

The only difference between the Font editor toolbox and the Bitmap 
editor toolbox is that (since font character bitmaps are monochrome) 
only two colors are ever displayed in the Font editor toolbox palette. 
For more information on the Bitmap editor toolbox, see Chapter 7, 
"Adding Look and Feel with Resources." 


<h3>Font properties</h3>

Fonts have four pages of properties. The General properties are 
shown in Figure 28-43.
