/*
 * This is a reimplementation of a subset of the pthread_getspecific/setspecific
 * interface. This appears to outperform the standard linuxthreads one
 * by a significant margin.
 * The major restriction is that each thread may only make a single
 * pthread_setspecific call on a single key.  (The current data structure
 * doesn't really require that.  The restriction should be easily removable.)
 * We don't currently support the destruction functions, though that
 * could be done.
 * We also currently assume that only one pthread_setspecific call
 * can be executed at a time, though that assumption would be easy to remove
 * by adding a lock.
