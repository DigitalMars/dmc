PortTool -- Win32 Porting Tool

Summary

The porting tool is used to help identify the places in the 16-bit source 
code that might need to change to make it 32-bit Win32-compatible. The 
tool provides a brief description of the problem and a possible solution.

More Information

The porting tool has two operating modes.  It can be run interactively or 
in the background.  The background mode inserts comments in the locations 
where issues are found. There is a section of PORT.INI (the file that the 
porting tool uses to help identify potential issues) available for entering 
programmer-defined strings. This allows the porting tool to be customized.
