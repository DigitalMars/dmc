	Apfcvt is used to convert executables or libraries so that
they load profiling libraries rather than their conventional
libraries.  Apfcvt works for both 16-bit and 32-bit programs.



1	GUI Interface

	The GUI interface provides for easy converting of binaries or
for setting up a "project" of conversions for automation.  Each
control of interface is explained below.


1.1	Binary List

	The Binary List shows the executables and libraries that will
be converted.  Double-clicking on an entry will display the current
state of its libraries, i.e., converted or not converted.

	Binaries may be added or removed using the ADD and REMOVE
buttons.  When adding binaries, an option can selected, RECURSIVE
LOAD, which causes all libraries that the binary uses to be loaded and
then all libraries that they use, etc.  These libraries do not have to
be in the same directory.  Apfcvt will search for them the same way
that Windows searches for libraries loaded with the LoadLibrary()
command.  If a library is already being used by another process, it
will not be loaded.

	For convenience when changing from computer to computer, a
Base Directory is associated with the binaries listing.  This base
directory holds the common path for the binaries.  For example, if the
following binaries were added:

	c:\apps\excel\excel.exe
	c:\apps\winword\winword.exe

the base directory would be "c:\apps" and the binaries listbox would
contain "excel\excel" and "winword\winword".  If one moves to another
computer where the paths of the binaries are:

	d:\excel\excel.exe
	d:\winword\winword.exe

the user would select the BASE DIRECTORY button and change it from
"c:\apps\" to "d:\"

	The Windows directory and the Windows System directory do not
lend themselves nicely to the concept of a base directory.  Therefore,
for any binary located in Windows or System directory, the binary name
is preceded by "%win%", "%sys%", or "%sys32%".  This also simplifies
changing from machine to machine since the Windows and System
directory may change from machine to machine (Ex: "\win", "\winnt",
:"\windows", etc.).


1.2	Modification List

	There are two listboxes (DON'T MODIFY and MODIFY) that used
for deciding which libraries to convert and which not to.  When a
binary is ADDed, its libraries are placed in one of the two lists
depending on its current state.  If the library is modified, it is
placed in the MODIFY list.  Keep in mind that these lists do not
necessarily reflect the true state of the libraries in each binary
(Double-click on a binary in the BINARY list to check its state).


1.3	Convert Character

	The CONVERT CHARACTER box holds the character to be used for
the conversion.  While changing this character changes the names in
the MODIFY list, the change does not take effect until the CONVERT
button is pressed (See next section).
	

1.4	Convert/Unconvert

	The CONVERT and UNCONVERT buttons are used for modifying the
libraries in the MODIFY list.  CONVERT replaces the first character of
each library with the CONVERT CHARACTER.  UNCONVERT switches the first
character back to its original value.  Keep in mind that UNCONVERT
only affects those libraries in the MODIFY list and not all libraries
that converted.


1.5	.CVT files

	The current settings can be saved and reloaded later by
choosing the options under the FILE menu.  The settings are saved as
as a .CVT file.  Besides the obvious benefits of saving and reloading
the settings, .CVT files can be used in conjunction with the command
line options for automation purposes.


2	Command Line Interface

	The command line options are divided into two categories:
support of the options for the old version of Apfcvt and .CVT
processing.


2.1	Old Style Command Line
	
	The format for the old Apfcvt is:

	apfcvt < new import names > < modules to convert >

For example:

	apfcvt fernel32 sol.exe freecell.exe

will cause the libraries "kernel32.dll" to be changed to "fernel32"
in the binaries "sol.exe" and "freecell.exe".  To undo this conversion,
the following command line would be used:

	apfcvt kernel32 sol.exe freecell.exe

	By not specifying any import names, Apfcvt will display the
import names of the specified binaries.  For example,

	apfcvt sol.exe freecell.exe

will display the import names of "sol.exe" and "freecell.exe".


2.2	.CVT Processing

	The command line format for .CVT processing is:

	apfcvt { /c | /u } < file.cvt >

The /c option loads the settings from the .CVT file and converts the
libraries in the MODIFY list.  The /u option does the same except it
unconverts the libraries.
