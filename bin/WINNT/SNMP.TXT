========================================================

The SNMP service for Windows NT requires that the TCPIP service
be running.  Use the network control panel application to install and 
configure the TCPIP service.  You can then also use the network control
panel application to install and configure the SNMP service.

When you install the SNMP service it adds the following files to your
<windir>\system32 directory

snmp.exe     -- The SNMP agent service
snmptrap.exe -- Receives SNMP traps and forwards them to mgmtapi.dll
mgmtapi.dll  -- DLL for generating SNMP management requests and
                receiving information
inetmib2.dll -- MIB II extension agent DLL
lmmib2.dll   -- LAN Manager MIB 2 extension agent DLL

If you are developing an extension agent DLL, you must configure
the registry so that the SNMP agent will load the extension agent
DLL.  You can use the regedt32.exe program that comes with Windows NT
to add this information.  SNMP configuration is found in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters.
You will need to add another entry under the ExtensionAgents Key.  Simply
follow the same format that you see for the existing extension agent DLLs--
that is provide a pointer to another registry entry that contains the 
physical path where the DLL can be found.  NOTE: the key name and values
are case sensitive.  Make sure that they match.  If you have problmes
look in the system log.  Also type "Net Help Start SNMP" to see how to
configure error logging of the SNMP agent.


You must stop and restart the SNMP service for it to load the new
extension agent DLLs.

The files in the SNMPUTIL directory contain the source to the 
SNMPUTIL.EXE utility.  The usage of this utility is:

usage:  snmputil [get|getnext|walk] agent community oid [oid ...] 
        snmputil trap                                             

This utility will allow you to retrieve data from any SNMP agent

In the MSTOOLS directory, you will find the MIB compiler.
The SNMP Programmer's Reference describes the usage of the MIB compiler
that creates the file MIB.BIN that the SNMPUTIL.EXE program uses.  
You can use the MIB compiler, MIBCC.EXE, to compile your own private
MIBs as well.  The file MIB.BIN must be placed in the path for the SNMP 
Manager APIs to be able to function properly.  MIBCC.EXE by default places
the file MIB.BIN in the <windir>\system32 directory.

The files in the TESTDLL directory are the sources for the TESTDLL.DLL.
This DLL impliments the toaster MIB.  See the note above about installing
this DLL.
