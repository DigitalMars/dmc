RIFFADD:
========

This is an utility that can be used to add text information 
or Bitmaps to RIFF files.

Features:
---------
Riffadd has both an interactive and batch mode. Riffadd works
only on Windows 95 now. It can be used to set text into DISP
and all known INFO chunks, and Bitmaps into DISP chunks. The 
user needs to specify an input and an output file (and an optional
script file for the batch mode). Riffadd adds/replaces info 
in the input file and writes to the output file. Riffadd can
handle text with extended characters or DBCS characters.

Command Line:
-------------
(1) Riffadd //prompts you for the Input and output files before 
	    //showing the UI

(2) Riffadd <input file> <output file>

(3) Riffadd /b <script file> //you will be prompted for other files

(4) Riffadd /b <script file> <input file> <output file>

Batch mode:
-----------
The batch mode uses a script file like the one shown below.
TEST.SCR is a sample script file.

For INFO chunks the format is

<Chunk type>=<<STRING:>/<FILE:>>,<<TEXT>/<File name>>

For DISP chunks use DISP_DIB or DISP_TEXT depending
on if you want CF_DIB or CF_TEXT to be the format of the
DISP chunk.

Script file processing uses Profile String API's. So
the script has to be in the [RIFFADD] section. Use 
"\r\n" to force a line break in the text.


[RIFFADD]
ISBJ=STRING,"This is the Subject, dude"
DISP_TEXT=FILE,e:\motown\riffadd\tmp\t1.txt
ITCH=STRING,"Who cares who the technician is"
ICMT=STRING,"This is the first line\r\nand this is next line"
DISP_DIB=FILE,e:\motown\riffadd\tmp\s1.dib
ICMS=FILE,e:\motown\riffadd\tmp\t2.txt
IPLT=STRING,"Screw the palette"

Notes:
------
(1) The maximum length of text is 512 bytes (not chars).
(2) When entering text in the edit window of the UI, if you
	need line breaks, use Ctrl+Return. If you just hit
	return the Prop. Sheet code eats the Return.
(3) We don't yet support other types of data (eg. Icons, Small
	Icons, etc).
(4) While the input and output files may have relative or absolute
pathnames, the script file must have the absolute path name unless it is
in the Windows directory.
